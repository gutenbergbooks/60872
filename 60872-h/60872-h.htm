<small>THE MAGICAL CHANCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;What</span> are you going to say to the college
girls?&#8221; my pretty niece asked, as we motored
down the valley. She was being graduated this
spring, and the snowy dogwoods and the purple
Judas-trees against the tender hillsides were
not so fresh, nor half so full of bloom, as she.
But they were gayer far than she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell them, uncle, how wonderful they
are! How the world waits for them! Don&#8217;t
say it, uncle! I have heard that sort of talk
for these four years, and here I am with nobody
waiting for me; not fitted for anything;
nothing to do; and as wonderful&mdash;as thirty
cents!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor thing!</p>

<p>A few days before, I had seen an interview
with the President of Yale, in which the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
writer said he had read in a book that all the
great devices had been invented; all the new
lands explored; all the great deeds done&mdash;all
the adventure and romance forever gone from
life, and that only bread and butter remain with
the odds against a young man&#8217;s getting much
of the butter.</p>

<p>Poor thing!</p>

<p>Have I been living fifty years&mdash;in America?
or fifty cycles in Cathay? I cannot still be young
at fifty! nor can I be so old either as modern
two-and-twenty! Youth is a dry tree, these
days; a sad state&mdash;particularly youth bent
with the burden of an A.B. degree. Out of my
fifty-odd years of existence I have taught college
youth for three-and-twenty, and never in all
that time have they looked like plain bread and
butter to me. If they are not adventure and
romance, not better stories, sweeter songs,
mightier deeds than any yet recorded, then I
am no judge of story matter and the stuff of
epic song.</p>

<p>But my pretty niece declares that she also
knows a shoat when she sees one; and she knows
it is just pork. As for the college man of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
interview: he was not speaking by the book;
out, rather, of the depths of his heart.</p>

<p>It is an evil thing to be born young into an
old world!</p>

<p>For the world seems very old. Its face is
covered with doubt, its heart is only ashes of
burned-out fires. The River of Life which John
saw has dwindled into Spoon River; and his
Book of Life is now a novel, piddling and prurient.
But John also saw the Scarlet Woman&mdash;and
that was long ago! The world was ever
much the same; ever in need of an Apocalypse;
and never more in need than now. My pretty
niece, and the young man of the interview, are
the world, and the college world at that, the
more&#8217;s the pity. They are its skepticism, its
materialism, its conventionalism, its fear and
failure. They seem afraid to bid on life, for fear
it might be knocked off to them at something
above par! They do not dare. They won&#8217;t take
a chance. They would, of course, if there <i>were</i>
chances; they would dare, if only one giant were
still left stalking through the land. The giants
are gone!</p>

<p>The orator was celebrating the hundredth anniversary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of Richard Henry Dana, the author of
&#8220;Two Years Before the Mast&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Life offered him a magical human chance and he
took it. There was something in him for which the
decorous and conventional life of Boston allowed no
place in its scheme. &#8220;Two Years Before the Mast&#8221;
belongs to the Literature of Escape.</p></blockquote>

<p>Life offered him a magical chance&mdash;as if he
were a special case! So he was. So is every boy.
Who was this boy? and what were the circumstances
under which Life offered him this magical
chance? He was a Bostonian to begin with, and
that is bad enough; he was a Harvard undergraduate
also, which still further complicates the
situation; and, besides, he was a Dana! Here
was a complex which should have staggered
Life. Who could escape from all of this? Leave
that to Life. Up she comes boldly, just as if she
expected the boy to take her offer. And he did
take it. He fell ill with some affliction of the eyes;
and, going down to the Boston wharfs, shipped
as a common sailor before the mast in the little
brig Pilgrim for a two years&#8217; trip around the
Horn. And out of that escape from Boston and
Harvard and the Danas, he brought back one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the three greatest sea stories in literature&mdash;a
book that all of Boston and Harvard and the
Danas combined could never have written except
for this escape.</p>

<p>The question is: Does Life come along to-day,
as then, and offer us, as it offered Dana, such a
magical chance? Is there any escape for us?</p>

<p>We are not all Danas, and so we are certainly
not worse off than he was; but our circumstances
are distinctly different, and rather disquieting.
This chance was given Dana far back in 1834,
nearly one hundred years ago, when escape was
possible, and when Dana was a boy. It was a
young world a hundred years ago, and full of
adventure. One could escape then because there
was some place to escape into; but to round the
Horn to-day is to land, not on wild Point Loma,
but at San Diego, with the single exception
of Monte Carlo, the most decorous and conventional
city on the planet.</p>

<p>Perhaps my niece and the college boy of the
interview are right.</p>

<p>About the time that Dana was escaping from
Boston, a young man by the name of Henry
David Thoreau tried to escape from Concord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the same State. He had no deep-sea wharf,
no brig like the Pilgrim, but, as one must seize
such things as are at hand in an escape, Thoreau
took a rowboat and the near-by river and
started off. He rowed and rowed for a week,
and came to Concord, New Hampshire. Here
he took to his diary and wrote that there were
no frontiers this way any longer. &#8220;This generation
has come into the world fatally late for some
enterprises. Go where we will on the surface of
things, men have been there before us. We cannot
have the pleasure of erecting the last house;
that was long ago set up in the suburbs of Astoria
City, and our boundaries have literally been run
to the South Sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Born in 1817, more than a hundred years ago,
and still born fatally late! How late, then, was
I born? and you, my son? and you, my pretty
niece?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;The rainbow comes and goes,</div>
<div class="verse">And lovely is the rose,</div>
</div></div>

<p>but you and I have missed the early glory that
hath passed forever from the morning earth,&#8221;
she makes reply.</p>

<p>But I would say to her: It was ten years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ten whole years after Thoreau&#8217;s tame adventure
on the Merrimac, that gold was discovered in
California. Here was a magical chance as late
as the year &#8217;Forty-Nine, and Life offered it to a
young man of Providence and Brooklyn by the
name of Bret Harte. He took it. There was
something in him for which the decorous and
conventional round of these cities allowed no
place in their scheme. He went into the gold-fields
and brought out &#8220;The Luck of Roaring
Camp,&#8221; another piece of the Literature of
Escape. Then my students answer: &#8220;Yes, but
there are no more outcasts in Poker Flat, and
whom are we to write about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, &#8217;tis true, they&#8217;re in their graves, that
gentle race of gamblers. With the wind-flower
and the violet they perished long ago, as literary
material. Eighteen-Forty-Nine will be having
its hundredth anniversary soon. But, some
fifty years later, gold was struck again&mdash;this
time on the Yukon. Here was another magical
chance. And there was a young fellow walking
the streets of Boston along with me, literally
begging bread with me from editorial door to
editorial door, by the name of Jack London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Life came up to us and offered us this magical
chance, and Jack took it, bringing out of the
Yukon a story called &#8220;Building a Fire&#8221; which
is surely a part of the immortal Literature of
Escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what would he write about now?&#8221;
they ask. &#8220;What has happened since?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peary has found the North Pole,&#8221; I reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Amundsen, or somebody, has
found the South Pole!&#8221; they cry. &#8220;And what&#8217;s
the use of living in a world of only two poles,
and some one finding both of them before we
come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is something in that. It is a bad sort
of world that has only two poles. It should be
stuck full of poles, one for each of us. But there
are only two, and a flag flies from each of them;
as a flag flies over every terrestrial spot in between
them: over Mount McKinley now; over
the River of Doubt now, so that we are stopped
from singing, as once we sang,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;There&#8217;s one more river,</div>
<div class="verse">There&#8217;s one more river to cross.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is no more river to cross. Theodore
Roosevelt crossed it. There is nothing to cross;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
no place to go where, on the surface of things,
men have not been there before us. Yes, yes,
there is Mount Everest. No one has yet stood
on that peak; but there is an expedition climbing
it, camping to-day at about twenty-five thousand
feet up, with only two or three thousand
feet more to go. And here we are in Hingham!</p>

<p>It looks bad. My young niece is possibly
right, after all. East, west, north, south, where
is a frontier? Where shall I go from here and
find an escape?</p>

<p>Not overland any longer, for even Thoreau
could find no frontier this way; and not by sea
now, for here comes John Masefield, poet and
sailor, saying the frontier has disappeared from
off the sea; that the clipper ship, the ship of
dreams, has foundered and gone down; that you
can haunt the wharves these piping times of
steam,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Yet never see those proud ones swaying home,</div>
<div class="verse">With mainyards backed and bows acream with foam.</div>

<div class="verse">As once, long since, when all the docks were filled</div>
<div class="verse">With that sea beauty man has ceased to build.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Listen, now, for this is the message of the
poem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;They mark our passage as a race of men,</div>
<div class="verse">Earth will not see such ships again,&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>which makes me thank Heaven for my farm,
where the same old romantic hoe remains about
what it ever was&mdash;the first recorded wedding
present.</p>

<p>Mr. Masefield&#8217;s observations are dated 1912.
Prior to that year real clipper ships rode the deep,
and real romance. It was prior to 1839 that
there were real frontiers and romance in the land,
and a last house (a government lighthouse)
still to be set up in the suburbs of Astoria City.
Going a little farther back, we find that prior
to 1491 (<small>B.C.</small>), about the year 4000 according to
the margin of the King James Version, there
were giants in the earth, and the stories in the
Book of Genesis show that there were romances
as well as giants in those days. But, like
Thoreau and Masefield, Moses was born fatally
late. I feel sorry for Moses and my niece.</p>

<p>Let us pause here for a sad brief moment in
order to see just where Moses was when Life
sought him out and proffered him a magical
chance in the shape of a trip to Egypt. Where
was Moses? and what was he doing? To begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with, he was keeping goats, a fairly common
occupation in those days, though rather a rare
job now. But that was not all: Moses was keeping
these goats for Jethro, his father-in-law.
Now you begin to get some inkling as to where
Moses was. But this is not the worst of it: for
Moses was keeping the goats for his father-in-law
on &#8220;the <i>back</i> side of the desert.&#8221; One would
certainly say that the <i>front</i> side of any desert
would be far enough away, and sterile enough
of romance, if one had to keep one&#8217;s father-in-law&#8217;s
goats there; but to keep the goats of your
father-in-law on the <i>back</i> side of a desert is to be
farther off than Hingham, or any place I know.
And here was Moses when Life came upon him
offering him an escape into Egypt.</p>

<p>He was born fatally late, Moses was, just like
Thoreau and my niece. He might have been one
of my own college men, so like a college man&#8217;s
was his answer!</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he complained, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
go down to Egypt. There is nothing doing down
in Egypt. I&#8217;m slow of speech; without imagination;
and it&#8217;s a hard job, anyway. Let me stay
here and be goatherd to Jethro, my father-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and dream of the good old days of the
giants, when men began to multiply upon the
face of the earth, when the sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they were fair. Ah!&mdash;there
was something doing in those days!&#8221;</p>

<p>From Moses to Masefield the times have been
fatally late. And so mine are, with the clipper
ships, the frontiers, the giants, and the daughters
of men that are fair, all gone! But I seem to see
them fair. I suppose I ought not, having been
born so fatally late. And I wonder if I might
not find a giant, too, if I should hunt? and a
clipper ship? and a frontier? and even an escape
from Hingham!</p>

<p>Lumber is still brought in boats to one of
Hingham&#8217;s old wharves, but the rest of her
wharves are deserted. Her citizens, who used to
do business in great waters, stop now in Hingham
Harbor to catch smelts. Change and some
decay one can see all about Hingham, but little
chance of escape.</p>

<p>Down at the foot of Mullein Hill, on which
my house stands, there runs a long, long trail
awinding into that land of my dreams; but I
ask: Where does it cross the frontier? I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
traveled it, going south, in my Ford (if you are
out for frontiers, take a Ford. We have a saying
here in Hingham that a Ford will take a man
anywhere&mdash;except into good society!)&mdash;I say
I have gone south over this road which runs at
the foot of Mullein Hill as far as Philadelphia,
and no frontier!&mdash;the next stop was Chester.
I have gone east over the same road until I came
to within ten miles of Skowhegan, Maine, where
I ran into a steam-roller on the road. When you
meet a steam-roller on a road in Maine, you are
very near the frontier. If there is any adventure
for you on the trip, it will be on the détour
around that steam-roller. But under the roller
ran the road and on into Skowhegan, and on out
of Skowhegan into Aroostook County, the
richest county in the United States, where they
raise &#8220;spuds&#8221; enough to feed, not only Boston,
but the rest of dear old Ireland with her; and all
the way from Hingham to Aroostook, except at
the steam-roller, there was no chance to get off.</p>

<p>And this road, taking a turn among these
glorious potato-fields of Maine, starts over the
mountains of New Hampshire, crosses the corn
and cattle belt in the central portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
country, and, running on and on, dips into the
Imperial Valley in far-off California, the hottest
cultivated spot on earth. And all the way from
Hingham, roundabout by Maine, to the Imperial
Valley, you may not stop, unless you run
out of &#8220;gas.&#8221; And the oil companies do not
intend this magical chance to attend you, for
they have planted gasoline tanks under every
second telegraph pole all the way.</p>

<p>This road, starting from Mullein Hill, Hingham,
and running to Aroostook, Maine, and to
the Imperial Valley in California, takes a new
turn among the melon-fields there, works its
way back along the Gulf States, binding their
ragged edge like a selvage, and, bending into
Florida, threads its way among the Everglades
and out, heading off across the cotton-fields, on
across the corn and cattle belt again, climbs
Pike&#8217;s Peak and down, climbs Mount Hood and
down, and, faring on into the State of Washington,
climbs the fruited slopes of old Tacoma,
&#8220;The Mountain that was God.&#8221; And all the
way from Hingham some one has been there
before us, and laid an oiled road for us, and left
us no frontier.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Surely we are born late; and my pretty niece
fatally late. The frontier is gone. The buffaloes
are gone. I saw their ancient trails out of the car
windows as my train roared over the Canadian
prairie, wavering parallel paths in the virgin
sod, a vivider green than the rest of the grass,
narrow meandering lines vanishing short of the
far-off horizon where hung a cloud not larger
than a man&#8217;s hand, like the dust of the last disappearing
herd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank&#8221; Monk is gone. This king of overland
stage-drivers sleeps in Carson City; and
beside sleeps his Concord coach of split hickory.
Concord has ceased to make such coaches.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">They mark our passage as a race of men,</div>

<p>From Hell Gate now to Golden Gate there are
only miles, and any machine makes a mere
holiday of the trip.</p>

<p>A young acquaintance of mine has just made
the coast-to-coast run, driving her own car.
She said to me on arriving here that &#8220;it was an
awful monotonous journey.&#8221; Didn&#8217;t anything
happen? I asked with considerable surprise.
No, nothing happened. Didn&#8217;t she see anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of interest? Wasn&#8217;t there any excitement?
Didn&#8217;t she have any adventures? No, she didn&#8217;t
see anything; she didn&#8217;t get a bit of excitement
out of it; there wasn&#8217;t any adventure; just one
blinkety-blank mile after another!</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said, her eyes brightening,
something like a thrill in her voice, &#8220;I did have
three punctures!&#8221;</p>

<p>All the way from Golden Gate to Hell Gate
with three punctures to break the cushioned
tenor of her way. This is what life has come to.</p>

<p>Then she said: &#8220;There were two things on the
trip that did greatly interest me. But I don&#8217;t
exactly know why; and I am afraid to tell you
about them for fear you will think me such a big
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I won&#8217;t think you any
bigger fool than I do now, so what were the two
interesting things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she began (and I wish the reader
would note the strictly American touch in this
description), &#8220;one of them was Luther Burbank&#8217;s
spineless cactus.&#8221; (Notice, I say, the spineless
quality of this cactus.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>The girl read my face and exclaimed, much
hurt: &#8220;There! I knew you would poke fun at
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell what the other thing was,&#8221; I begged.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the sordid story over as fast as we
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know even yet what it all meant,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;but, as I was crossing the Arizona
desert, I saw a long petition being circulated by
the native Arizonians, praying the National
Congress to preserve for them and for posterity
a portion of their original desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>My poor niece! Moses saw the giants pass
away; Thoreau saw the frontier pass away;
Masefield sees the clipper ship pass away; but it
remains for my niece and her day to see the
Great American Desert wiped out by the
irrigation ditch, and the gila monster with the
desert, and the need of a shovel on the trip
across the sands! Have we eaten the cassaba
melon and gone mad? Is it all of life to make
the desert blossom as the rose? To bring forth
cassaba melons, and alligator pears, and spineless
cacti for cow feed?</p>

<p>Ploughing the desert; turning the giant cactus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into ensilage, as if to live were a silo&mdash;for fear
of this the native Arizonians are asking Congress
that a portion of their original desert and of
Life&#8217;s adventure and romance be saved to them
and to their children.</p>

<p>It is sad. But this is not the worst of it: for
they have laid an oiled road across that desert,
as if it were the whole of life to get through to
San Diego on time.</p>

<p>There is no hope for a man who gets through
to San Diego on time. He will strike Los
Angeles on time, come to San Francisco on time.
Portland on time, Winnipeg, Chicago, Boston,
and Hingham on time; where he will die on time,
be buried on time, rise on time, and keep going
on time, with never a chance to get off. But
where is the adventure in that? It is not the
whole of life to get through to San Diego on
time. I had rather leave my bones to bleach
beneath a bush than travel on and on by schedule,
always making life&#8217;s connections, and so
missing always life&#8217;s magical chances. Don&#8217;t you
remember your Mother Goose, wise old dear?</p>

<p>And he was the only little duffer in the whole

this boy (he certainly was a boy) came late and
has become immortal.</p>

<p>The desert is doomed, no doubt, but we shall
always have détours; and if &#8220;on the surface of
things men have been there before us,&#8221; we must
go beneath. There are giants still in these days;
the daughters of men are still fair; there are
frontiers for those who will find them; and,
clipper ships or no, I believe in the everlasting
adventure of rounding the Horn. I believe in
magical chances of escape, born though I was
after my parents, which might have been fatally
late had I not happily come before my children,
each of whom is an adventure and an escape.
Wherever I turn, I see a chance to sidestep the
decorous, the conventional, the scheduled, to
dodge into the bushes and escape. Every day
is an adventure.</p>

<p>There are magical human chances to go round;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there is adventure and escape for everybody who
will seize it. Youth is as young, the world as
round, the earth as wild as ever. And, in spite
of all those who have grown old, it is still appareled
in celestial light&mdash;sunlight, starlight,
moonlight&mdash;or else wrapped in ancient and
adventurous dark. The sun still knoweth his
going down, thank Heaven! There are some
things that do not change nor pass away.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all
the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</p>

<p>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their
meat from God.</p>

<p>The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together,
and lay them down in their dens.</p>

<p>Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour
until the evening.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then look out for your men-folks. For this
is the end of the decorous and conventional.
This is the time wherein all the beasts of the
forest do creep forth.</p>

<p>We are what we always were, and so are things
what they always were, though they look different.
We have changed the spots of a few
leopards, the skins of a few Ethiopians, and
shifted the frontier from the dark wild heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the forest to the wild dark heart of the city;
but we have not changed the darkness, or the
wildness, or the Ethiopian, or the leopard.</p>

<p>I have seen the evening come over the city, a
night deep with darkness and wild with a great
storm blowing salty from the sea. I have watched
the streets grow empty till the shadow feet of
Midnight echoed as they passed, and all the
doors were shut. Then I have crept down along
the dark wet ways, bleak and steep-cut as cliffs,
where I have heard the beating of great wings
above the roofs, the call of wild shrill voices along
the craggy covings, and the wash and splash of
driving rains aslant the walls; I have tasted
brine, spume, and spindrift on the level winds,
flying through a city&#8217;s streets from far at sea&mdash;&#8220;one-way&#8221;
streets by day, and so clogged that
traffic could barely move in that one way&mdash;but
here&mdash;in the hushed tumult of the storm
and night&mdash;I could hear the stones crying out
of their walls, and the beams out of the timbers
answering them; the very cobbles of the pavement
having tongues that would speak when
the din of the pounding hoofs was past.</p>

<p>Some one complained to Browning that Italy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the only land of romance now left to us. The poet
answered promptly, &#8220;I should like to include
dear old Camberwell.&#8221; And I should like to
include dear old Haleyville and dear old Hingham.
And you would like to include dear old
Wig Lane, if you were born there.</p>

<p>But I started out from Hingham, pages back,
to find the frontier. Have I found it yet? So
Abraham started out from Ur of the Chaldees
to find a frontier, which he called a &#8220;City without
Foundations,&#8221; and did he find it? Whether
he did or not, he certainly had a plenty of adventure
by the way. Abraham was a hundred
years old when Isaac was born. There is something
thrilling about that. Yet, narrow as that
chance was, it is nothing when compared with
what happened to him next. For, when Abraham
was one hundred and <i>forty</i> years old, he
married Keturah. Here was a man who would
not be put down by a little circumstance like
one hundred and forty years. Life comes along
at one hundred and forty and offers Abraham
Keturah, and he takes her!</p>

<p>I say he may not have found his city. We
know that he did find Keturah&mdash;which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
vastly more of an adventure. We may not have
the pleasure of erecting the last house in the
suburbs of Astoria City, as Thoreau says; but
we might have the wilder adventure of living in
it. And as it happens to be a government lighthouse
out on Tongue Point, at the mouth of the
Columbia; and as it happens to be where the
night and the rain and the fog are thickest on
the face of the globe, life in that last house is
a constant frontier.</p>

<p>One might never leave Ur were he not seeking
a city. And one must never find his city else
he might cease his seeking. I do not know how
old Abraham was when he set out from Ur of
the Chaldees. I left Haleyville at the age of
eight. I have only lately come to Hingham,
having got in on the wrong side of the railroad
track some twenty years ago. (If one is really to
arrive in Hingham, one must come in with one&#8217;s
ancestors, and more than twenty years before.)
I say, I was eight when I left Haleyville; that
I have hardly yet arrived in Hingham; but all
the way from Haleyville to Hingham, and all
the way from Hingham to&mdash;Heaven, dare I
say?&mdash;there has been, and there shall be, held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
out, in both of Life&#8217;s hands to me, the magical
chance of escape.</p>

<p>Did I start out from Hingham to find the
frontier? That was wrong. I will start back for
Hingham. Hingham <i>is</i> the frontier. So was
Haleyville. So will Heaven be. Life with the
earth goes round, not forward, except to complete
a circuit established when the stars were
fixed, an orbit that all the forces of Heaven and
human intelligence have been unable to warp.
The only variation or shadow of new turning
Earth herself can look forward to is from collision
with some mad comet, which, if she lasts long
enough, may happen possibly within fifteen
million years&mdash;a square head-on smash it
may be, or only a side-swipe with a severe
shaking up&mdash;and then fifteen million years
more of steady turning. Things outside are
rather hard and fast despite appearances,
and we who are parts of this even scheme,
we find that our uprisings and downsittings
have never varied much from rule, nor are
liable to.</p>

<p>We are, I repeat, what we always were, and so
are things what they always were, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
look different. So is life what it always was for
adventures and frontiers.</p>

<p>The wild frontier, like the hunted fox, has
doubled on its trail, that is all. Romance has
slipped out of the woods into the deeper places
of the city; Adventure has turned commuter;
and here are the three to companion life, as they
ever have&mdash;the Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to
a bebundled D&#8217;Artagnan. And already it is
more than &#8220;Twenty Years Since.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twenty years, or a hundred years&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;The year&#8217;s at the spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you do not find your fill of adventure with
Davy Balfour in Appin, come down with him to
Dean&mdash;to Edinburgh, and you shall see the face
of such danger &#8220;in the midst of what they call
the safety of a town&#8221; as may shake you, too,
&#8220;beyond experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t find the frontier in the daylight,
wait for the dark. Every night is a fresh
frontier. There are no landmarks of the day but
are blotted out by the dark as the lines are
sponged in the wake of a steamer&#8217;s keel. On the
shortest night of this year wild rabbits were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
my garden, fox-hounds were baying beyond the
quarries, and through the thin early mist of the
dawn we were all at the window watching a wild
doe behind the barn. She nipped the clover
nervously, twitched her tail, pricked her ears
(for the day was approaching), and took the
high wire fence at a bound. She was as wild and
free as the wind.</p>

<p>A few Sunday nights ago I was at church
when the minister announced a series of evening
sermons for young people, and, to my utter
astonishment, his first talk was to be &#8220;Against
Sowing Wild Oats.&#8221; I was greatly tempted to ask
him if he intended to prevent his young people
from doing any more farming. If they couldn&#8217;t
sow wild oats, what kind of oats could they sow?
Did he ever see any tame oats? Those preachers
imagine a vain thing who think we ever cease
to sow wild oats (at least, there is many a late
crop, as Thackeray says). The truth is there
are no oats but wild ones.</p>

<p>I do not know what seed catalogue you order
your garden seeds out of; I get mine out of one
marked &#8220;Honest Seeds&#8221;; it is assuring to have
an order-book of this sort plainly stamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
&#8220;honest&#8221; on the cover. In this honest-seed
catalogue for the current year the seedsman,
on page 56, is describing his oats. Let the
preacher on wild oats note with critical care
the terms of this description. There is something
theological, at least, revivalistic, about
them. It is the only oat described in the catalogue;
and it would be the only oat to plant in
all the world, if it were, as it is described, a
&#8220;Regenerated Select Swedish Oat.&#8221; A &#8220;regenerated&#8221;
(that is Methodist) &#8220;select&#8221; (that
is Presbyterian) oat! But read on through this
catalogue, and you will find that every seed
and tuber from artichoke to zinnia has been to
a revival since last summer and hit the &#8220;sawdust
trail.&#8221; Great revivalists are the seedsmen!
Their work, however, is not permanent. For
they know, and we all know, that every regenerated
select Swedish oat in their bins is a
backslider at heart, as wild as the wild ass of
the wilderness that scorneth the crying of the
driver.</p>

<p>It is true of the seed and true of the soil in
which it grows. This spring I brought in from
the garden a frozen lump of earth which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
been subduing, after the fashion of Scripture,
with my hoe, these twenty years. Nay, that
lump of earth had been in process of being subdued
for nigh two hundred years, here on this
ancient Hingham farm. It was a bit of regenerated,
select soil, which I had sweetened with
lime, had nourished with nitrogen and potash,
and had planted with nothing but regenerated,
select seeds out of this honest catalogue. I put
this lump of soil in a pot by a south window and
tenderly planted more regenerated, select seeds
within its breast&mdash;tomato seeds, Jewel, Earliana,
and Bonny Best. Then I looked that it
should bring forth tomato plants, and it brought
forth within the pot, at the end of two weeks,
pig-weed, horse-weed, chick-weed, smart-weed,
white-weed, rag-weed, knot-weed, tumble-weed,
milk-weed, silk-weed, sneeze-weed, poke-weed;
goose-grass, crab-grass, witch-grass, wire-grass,
spear-grass; burdock, sourdock, and <i>pusley</i>; to
say nothing of the swarm of things from Europe,
whose infant cotyledons looked innocent enough,
but whose roots were altogether evil.</p>

<p>Life offered that lump of mother earth its
magical chance and the lump took it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
innate badness of it, this cared-for, chemically
pure, subdued piece of garden soil! Its frozen
heart a very furnace of smouldering fires; its
breast, that suckled the nursing salsify in the
summer, a bed of such wild spores as would sow
a world to weeds! Given tomato seeds, regenerated,
select tomato seeds, Jewel, Earliana,
and Bonny Best, the lump of earth brings forth
its own original pig-weed, horse-weed, chick-weed,
smart-weed, white-weed, rag-weed, knot-weed,
tumble-weed, milk-weed, silk-weed,
sneeze-weed, poke-weed; goose-grass, crab-grass,
witch-grass, wire-grass, spear-grass; burdock,
sourdock, and pusley. That is what it
brought forth a million years ago. A million
years from now, subdued and sweetened and
nourished, and planted with regenerated, select
tomato seed, Jewel, Earliana, and Bonny Best,
and put in a pot in the sunshine of the south
window, that lump of earth will bring forth
pig-weed, horse-weed, chick-weed, smart-weed,
white-weed, rag-weed, knot-weed, tumble-weed,
milk-weed, silk-weed, sneeze-weed, poke-weed,
goose-grass, crab-grass, witch-grass, wire-grass,
spear-grass; burdock, sourdock, and pusley.</p>

in any other of his hymns. To know that we
still inherit a portion of the original Adam,
if only the naughty of him, is tremendously
heartening. Anything original, if only original
sin, in this day of the decorous and the conventional,
is stimulating. For, if we do still
come by all of Adam&#8217;s original badness, do we
not, by the same token, come by all of his original
goodness, and are we not then wholly original,
as the original Adam? We must be; as surely
as the clod is; full, like the clod of wild weed-seed,
and capable, like the clod, under the proper
care, of producing tomato plants: Jewel, Earliana,
and Bonny Best, regenerate and select.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>I say the heart of a man is of the same steady
stuff as the other clay. What it was, it is, and
will be&mdash;wild, and ever seeking an escape from
the decorous, the conventional, the routine of
his subdued and ordered round.</p>

<p>How constant the heart of nature is to itself
I saw again the other day at Walden Pond.
Almost half a century before I came to this
planet, Thoreau wrote of Walden Pond: &#8220;But
since I left those shores the woodchoppers have
still further laid them waste, and now for many
a year there will be no more rambling through
the aisles of the wood, with occasional vistas
through which you see the water.&#8221; Those many
years have long since come and gone. Thoreau
is gone; his cabin is gone; and a cairn of stones
marks the spot where it stood. Over the stumps
he saw, tall stranger trees now stand; and once
more there is rambling through their shadowy
aisles, and vistas through which you catch
glimpses of the beloved face of Walden, calm
and pure as when he last looked upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, here is Walden!&#8221; I hear him exclaim,
&#8220;the same woodland lake that I discovered so
many years ago; where a forest was cut down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
last winter another is springing up by its shore
as lusty as ever; the same thought is welling up
to its surface as was then; it is the same liquid
joy and happiness to itself and its maker, aye&#8221;&mdash;and
it has now been set aside as a reservation
that its liquid joy and happiness may be ours
forever.</p>

<p>Change is constant, but it is the change of
the ever-returning wheel. Thoreau&#8217;s cabin is
gone, and no other cabin can now be built on the
shores of Walden Pond. But the trees have
come back to stay, and if, &#8220;on the surface of
things&#8221; Thoreau &#8220;has been there before us,&#8221;
we must go below or above the surface and find
our frontier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Magical chances?&#8221; a young aviator on the
Pacific Coast wrote lately. &#8220;I thought of them
to-day as I flirted with a little bunch of cotton-wool
clouds eight thousand five hundred feet
above Point Loma. And I wondered what Dana
would have thought had one of his shipmates
sauntered across the deck of the Pilgrim, and,
clapping him on the back, said: &#8216;I&#8217;ll meet you,
old man, in fifteen minutes up there in that
fleet of little clouds; if they whift and drift into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
space, wait for me at the five-thousand-foot
altitude&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>So the frontier comes back. Pushed past the
suburbs of Astoria City into the Pacific, it is
seen crawling out on the sandy shores of Cape
Cod with the next great storm. The single line
of human footsteps across the polar snows has
not left too packed and plain a trail. New snows
have covered it, as new trees have shadowed the
shores of Walden.</p>

<p>Peary&#8217;s footprints, and Dr. Cook&#8217;s, too, would
be very hard to follow.</p>

<p>It was more than twenty-five years ago that
I started from Savannah over the old stage-road
to Augusta, finding my way by faint uncertain
blazings on the tree-trunks through a hundred
and thirty-odd miles of swamp. They were
solemn miles. Trees thicker than my body grew
in the ruts where wheels had run; more than
once the great diamond rattlesnake coiled in my
path, chilling the silence of the river bottoms
with his shivering whirr. Once I heard the gobble
of the wild turkey and the scream of the bobcat;
and at night, while sleeping in an old abandoned
church on the river bluff, I was awakened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the snuffling of a bear which had thrust its
muzzle underneath the church door in the foot-worn
hollow of the sill.</p>

<p>It was a lonesome place. A faint road led
away from it off through the swamp; but, aside
from the gravestones near by, there were no other
human signs around. How long since human
feet had crossed the threshold, I do not know.</p>

<p>The chintz altar-cloth that I tried to draw
over me (the night was chill) crumbled at my
touch and drifted off into a million dusty fragments.
I had meant no desecration. I was very
weary and had crept in through a window from
the night and cold. A slow rain had settled down
with the dusk, attended by darkness indescribably
profound. And beneath the long-draped
pines outside slept those whose feet had worn
the threshold&mdash;slept undisturbed by the soughing
of the wind, wrapped in the unutterable
loneliness of the coiling river and the silent,
somber swamp.</p>

<p>Yet here had passed a highway between two
great cities just a few years earlier, before the
railroad was built farther out through the State.
Already the swamp and the river had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
highway for their own, and from human feet
given it again to adventure, to the gliding form,
the swift wing, and the soft padded foot.</p>

<p>The giants of old, the frontiers and clipper
ships of old, are gone. They went out with the
ebb tide, and here already comes back the flood!
And with it the same old human chance, the
magical chance of escape. Lay aside the rifle
and you pick up the camera&mdash;to creep with it
into the lion&#8217;s den; or to climb with it into the
top of a towering oak, on some sheer mountain
wall; and, pushing it before you along a horizontal
limb, feet dangling in space, a stiff wind
blowing, eagles screaming overhead, canyon wall
below you, and far, far down the narrow canyon
bottom, you hold on, body balancing camera,
but nothing over against the swaying brain,
and grind out a hundred feet of movie film. This
is to shoot a good many lions.</p>

<p>Life offers us all the chance of escape. Go
where we will on the surface of things, men have
been there before us; but beneath the surface we
need go no deeper than our own hearts to find
a frontier, and that adventurous something for
which the decorous and conventional allows no
place in its scheme.</p>

<small>THE RADIUM OF ROMANCE</small></h2>

<p class="center">&#8220;Why thus longing, thus forever sighing?&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Because,</span> I suppose, there were once two sides
to her bread-board, both of which she used for
sketching. She brought the board from the Fine
Arts room at college to her new home, carrying it
one day to the kitchen to try her hand at modeling&mdash;in
dough. There are several of her early
sketches about the house, of that period prior to
the dough, which show real talent. Her bread,
however, had about it the touch of genius.
The loaves grew larger all the time, the bakings
more frequent. The walls of any house are rather
quickly covered with pictures, but there is no
bottom to the bread-box. There are still two sides
to her bread-board, and she uses both sides for
dough.</p>

<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Why thus longing, thus forever sighing?</div>
<div class="verse">For the far-off, unattained and dim?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Because, I suppose, time was when I thought of
other things than the price of flour; not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of much money in those times, but because she
made angel-cake most of the time then, and
what bread we did eat was had of the baker;
and because the price of flour was then a matter
of course. The price of flour now is a good deal
more than a matter of course, and the price of
corn-meal even more than the price of flour; so
that we must count the slices now, and cut them
thin.</p>

<p>We shall have angel-cake again, I promise the
children, with the biggest kind of a hole in the
middle, giving them a bran muffin to munch
meanwhile, and wondering in my heart if this
fight for bread will ever end in angel-cake.</p>

<p>One can live on potatoes and bran muffins,
although there was never any romance about
them, not even during the Great War when
Wall Street took them as collateral. We need
cake. I don&#8217;t remember that I ever lacked potatoes
as a child, but, as a child, I do remember
dancing while the pickaninnies sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>in an ecstasy of pure delight, which was not
remotely induced by common hunger.</p>

<p>Short&#8217;nin&#8217; cake, angel-cake, floating island,
coffee jelly&mdash;are they not victuals <i>spirituels</i>,
drifted deep with frosting, honeyed over with an
amber-beaded sweat, with melting sweetness,
insubstantial, impalpable, ethereal, that vanish
into the brain, that thrill along the nerves, feeding
not the body, not the mind, nor yet the
spirit, for these are but three of our four elements&mdash;we
are also the stuff that dreams are
made of, and we cannot wholly subsist on more
material fare.</p>

<p>What makes pie pie is its four-and-twenty-blackbirds.
Singing-blackbird pie is the only
pie, whether you make it of apples or rhubarb
or custard or squash, with one crust or two.
He dreamed a dream who made the original pie.
And even now I cannot pass a baker in apron
and paper cap without a sense of frostings and
méringues&mdash;of the white of life separated from
the yolk of life and stirred into a dream. I find
the same touch of romance on many faces, both
young and old, as I find it over the landscape at
dusk and dawn, and on certain days even at
high noon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>It was so this morning when a flock of migrating
bluebirds went over, calling down to me.
They came out of the dawn, hovered idly over
the barn and the tops of the cedars in the pasture,
then faded into the blue about them and
beyond them, where a fleet of great white clouds
was drifting slowly far off to the south. But their
plaintive voices floating down to me I still hear
calling, with more yearning than a man, perhaps,
should allow himself to know. For at the
first sip of such sweet misery some poet chides,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Why thus longing, thus forever sighing</div>
<div class="verse">For the far-off, unattained and dim,</div>
<div class="verse">While the beautiful, all about us lying,</div>
<div class="verse">Offers up its low perpetual hymn?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>As if longing were a weakness and not the heart&#8217;s
hope; and our sighing&mdash; Shall I sigh for what
I have? Or stop sighing? Some of my possessions
I may well sigh over, but there are very
few to sigh for, seeing none of them are farther
off than the barn or the line fence, except a
few books that I have lent my friends, and
now and then a few dollars.</p>

<p>And such is the magic in the morning light
that I see the beautiful all about me lying&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the bend of the road, on the sweep of the
meadow, across the commonplace dooryard
asleep in the sun; and such is the sweet silence of
the autumn day that I hear the low perpetual
hymn&mdash;in the lingering notes of the bluebirds,
in the strumming of the crickets, in the curving
stems of the goldenrods, the loud humming of
the aster-dusted bees, even in the wavering red
leaves of the maples singing in their fall.</p>

<p>It lacks an hour of mail-time, and the newspaper,
and the world. The bluebirds are leaving
before the mail-man comes, and everything with
wings is flying with them, or is poised for flight
as if there were no world, except a world for
wings.</p>

<p>The day is warm, with little breezes on the
wing, hardly larger than swallows. They stir
the grasses of the knoll, and race with them up
the slope, to fly on over the wavy crest, following
the bluebirds off toward the deep-sea spaces
among the drifting clouds. And the curving
knoll itself is in motion, a yellow-brown billow
heaving against the moving clouds where they
ride along the sky. And over the knoll sweep
the hawking swallows, white bellies and brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and glinting steel-blue backs aflash in the sun.
Winging swallows, winging seeds, winging winds,
winging clouds and spheres, and my own soul
winging away into the beckoning blue where
the bluebirds have gone!</p>

<p>But I shall return&mdash;to the mail-box on this
rural free delivery route, to the newspaper, to
the tariff, to the Turk. The Democratic State
Committee is assembled this day in Springfield.
I am not there. I also ran. I stumped the State
for nomination to the National Senate, and
landed here on Mullein Hill, Hingham. Here
I set out. Through many years I have developed
the safe habit of returning here. It was a magical
chance Life offered me; a dream of beating the
protective tariff devils. But Mullein Hill is
clothed with dreams; and magical chances make
this their stopping-place.</p>

<p>It is certainly true to-day. To begin with,
I have this day bought the field by the side of
my house. For all the twenty years of my living
here I have dreamed of this rolling field with its
pines and pointed cedars, and rounded knoll
against the sky. Not every day in the autumn
is like this for dreams; not many of them in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the year. I shall be building fences about the
field now for many days; and paying taxes on the
field every day from this time on. There are
not many autumn days like this for dreams.
Yet to know one such day, one touched with
this golden melancholy, this sweet unrest and
yearning, should it not outlast the noon, is to
know,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;And one thing more that may not be,</div>
<div class="verse">Old earth were fair enough for me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>You say that I am still thinking of the United
States Senate. Possibly. &#8220;One thing more that
may not be&#8221; I must be thinking on, for we all
are. After the nomination comes the election;
and what chance has the sworn enemy of a high
protective tariff of election in Massachusetts?</p>

<p>Old Earth is fair enough for me ordinarily,
and she is passing fair to-day. But even the
dog, for all his appetite and growing years, is
not always satisfied with bread and play. He
clings closer than ever to me, as if sometimes
frightened at inner voices calling him, which,
like deep waters, seem to widen between us, and
which no love, though pure and immeasurable,
may be able to cross. He is nothing uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as a dog, except in the size of his spirit and the
quality of his love. He will tackle anything,
from a railroad train to a buzzing bumble-bee,
that he imagines has intentions inimical to me;
and there is nothing on the move, either coming
or going, quite innocent of such intentions. Without
fear, or awe, or law, he wears his collar, and
his license number, 66, but not as a sign of bondage,
for that sign he wears all over his alert and
fearless front. He growls in his sleep before the
fire at ghosts of things that have designs against
the house; he risks his life all day long.</p>

<p>But he reserves a portion of his soul. He will
deliberately chew off his leash at night, and,
making sure that nothing stirs about the helpless
house, will steal away to the woods, where he
hears the baying of some spectral pack down the
forest&#8217;s high-arched halls. I do not know what
the little cross-bred terrier is hunting along the
frosted paths&mdash;fox or rabbit or wild mice; I
cannot run the cold trails that are so warm to
his nose; but far ahead of his nose lope two
panting hearts, his and mine, following the
Gleam.</p>

<p>All dogs are dreamers, travelers by twilight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
who wander toward a slow deferring dawn. They
cannot see in the white fire of noon. A lovelier
light, diffused and dim with dusk, is in the eyes
of dogs and all dumb creatures, through which
they watch a world of shadows moving with them
like lantern-lighted shapes at night upon a wall.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Not of the sunlight,</div>
<div class="verse">Not of the moonlight,</div>
<div class="verse">Not of the starlight,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>is the tender, troubled light in the eyes of dogs.</p>

<p>There is a deposit, an infinitesimal deposit,
it may be, of the radium of romance in the slag
of all souls. Call it by other names&mdash;optimism,
idealism, religion&mdash;you still leave it undefined;
an inherent, essential element, harder to separate
from the spiritual dross of us than radium from
its carnotite; a kind of atomic property of the
spirit which breaks up its substance; which
ionizes, energizes, and illumines it.</p>

<p>There may be souls that never knew its
power, but I can hardly think there ever was a
soul shut in a cave so darksome, that romance
never entered with its touch of radiance, if only as</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;A little glooming light, much like a shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the light in the eyes of dogs, the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that birds and bees follow, and the jellyfish
steering round and round his course. Something
like its quivering flame burns down in the green,
dismal depths of the sea; down in the black
subliminal depths; and on down in the heart of
the world. For what other light is it, that guides
the herring every spring, in from the ocean up
Weymouth Back River? or the salmon in from
the Pacific, up, high up the Columbia to the
Snake, and higher up the Snake into the deep,
dark gorges of the Imnaha?</p>

<p>It is now long past October, and where is the
bluebird&#8217;s mate of June? She has forgotten him,
and is forgotten by him, but he has not forgotten
his dream-of-her; for I saw him in the orchard,
while southward bound, going in and out of the
apple-tree holes, the lover still, the dream-of-her
in his heart, holding over from the summer and
coming to meet him ahead of her, down the
winter, out of the coming spring.</p>

<p>The dog and you and I and even the humble
toad are dreamers at heart, all of us, only we are
deeper adream than they.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>says Freneau to a flower. Yet the flowers are of
the dust that I am made of, and they too are
the stuff of dreams. And the toad under the
kitchen-steps, what he knows of my heart! As
if the unrequited pain of lovers, the sweetest,
saddest things of poets, had always been his
portion, and their vague melancholy the only
measure of his tremulous twilight song. When
the soft spring dusk has stolen into the young
eyes of the day, as the first shadow of some sweet
fear into the startled eyes of a girl, then out of
the hush, quavering through the tender gloom,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;A voice, a mystery!&#8221;</p>

<p>From his earth-hole under the kitchen-steps
I have known the toad, by dint of stretching
and hitching up on chance stones, to get nine
inches up, nine inches from the surface of the
globe, up on the lowest of the steps! Yet it is
given him to pipe a serenade in the gloaming
that no other lover, bird or poet, ever quite
equaled, even when he sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;I arise from dreams of thee</div>
<div class="verse">In the first sweet sleep of night.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Life is always a romance. There is fire in its
heart, even in the three cold chambers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
toad&#8217;s heart; and the light of the fire flickers
fainter than the guttered candle before it will go
out. This may not be &#8220;the true light&#8221;; yet it
lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
every man with a pen, and his brother with a
hoe, though they comprehend it not. One of
our poets has written of &#8220;The Man With The
Hoe&#8221; and left the man out and put only the
hoe in the poem. This poet has written more
than he has hoed, I am sure; as the painter of
&#8220;The Man with the Hoe&#8221; had painted more
than he had hoed, I am sure. Here is a poet who
sees no light at all in &#8220;The Man with the Hoe,&#8221;
because that poet has written more than he has
hoed, which is to gather where he has not
strawed. When a hoe looks as black as this to a
pen, you will search the premises of the pen in
vain for hoes. I hoe; I know men who hoe; and
none of us knows Mr. Markham&#8217;s scarecrow for
ourself. Here a realist sees what another realist
thought he saw; as if you could ever <i>see</i> life!</p>

<p>Life is not what the realist sees, but what the
realist is and knows, plus what the man with
the hoe is and knows; and he knows that, if
chained to a pick instead of a hoe, down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
black pit of some Siberian mine, he could not
work life out in the utter dark.</p>

<p>Realism, if not a distortion and a disease, is
at best only a half-truth; and the realist, if more
than a medical examiner for his district, is but
the undertaker besides.</p>

<p>Whoever sings a true song, or pens the humblest
plodding prose, whether of Achilles, son of
Peleus, or of John Gilley, a milkman down in
Maine, or of the toad, or of the bee, has essentially
one story to tell, and must be a Homer,
truly to tell it.</p>

<p>Here on my desk lies the story of John Gilley,
and over in the next farmhouse lingers the unwritten
story of another milkman, my neighbor,
Joel Moore; and in the other neighbor-houses
live like people&mdash;humble, humdrum country
people, with their stories, which, if lighted with
nothing but their own hovering gleam, would
glow forever.</p>

<p>The next man I meet would make a book;
for either he is, or he knows, a good-enough
story, could I but come by the tale.</p>

<p>O. Henry, pacing the streets in an agony of
fear at having run out of story-matter, is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a case of nerves. The one inexhaustible supply
of matter in the Universe that is of use to
man is story-matter; for, as the first human
pair have been a perpetual song and story, so the
last pair shall be the theme for some recording
angel, or else they will leave a diary.</p>

<p>The real ill with literature is writer&#8217;s cramp,
an inability to seize the story, all of it, its truth
as well as its facts&mdash;an ill, not of too much
observation, but of too little imagination. Art
does not watch life and record it. Art loves life
and creates it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows the stars,&#8221; says Stevenson,
&#8220;who has not slept, as the French happily put
it, <i>à la belle étoile</i>. He may know all their names,
and distances, and magnitudes, and yet be ignorant
of what alone concerns mankind, their
serene and gladsome influence on the mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Art and literature have turned scientist of
late, as if our magnitudes, names, and distances,
as if the concern of psychologists, physiologists,
ethnologists, criminologists, and pathologists,
were the concern of mankind! These things all
belong to the specialists.</p>

<p>What does mankind reck of the revolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the node and apsides? that Neptune&#8217;s line of apsides
completes its revolution in 540,000 years?
Instead of an astronomer, mankind is still the
simple shepherd, keeping watch by night, and
all he knows of the stars is that they brood above
the sleeping hills, and now and then, in some
holy hush, they sing together.</p>

<p>Science is concerned with the names, distances,
and magnitudes of the stars; and with problems
touching the &#8220;intestinal parasites of the flea.&#8221;
Art, literature, and religion are concerned only
with mankind; with the elemental, the universal,
the eternal; with the dream, the defeat, the
romance of life.</p>

<p>I have much to do with writers&mdash;with great
writers, could they only think of something to
write about. &#8220;There is nothing left,&#8221; they cry,
&#8220;to write about.&#8221; &#8220;But here am I. Take me,&#8221;
I answer. Out come pads and pencils flying.
There is hard looking at me for a moment. Then
a cynical smile. I won&#8217;t do. Becky might have
done, but Thackeray got her; just as some one
has got everybody! My tribe can never furnish
her like again. Yet my tribe is not infertile; it is
Thackeray&#8217;s, rather, that has run out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>A sweet young thing in one of my extension
courses, voicing the literary despair of the class
in a poem called &#8220;The Fairy Door,&#8221; made this
end of the whole matter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;The world seems black and ugly</div>
<div class="verse">When I shut the Fairy Door;</div>
<div class="verse">I want to go to Fairyland</div>
<div class="verse">And live forever more.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I was reading this effusion on my way in to
college. When I reached the climax in the
stanza,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;The world seems black and ugly&#8221;</p>

<p>I thrust the manuscript back into my bag in
disgust and turned for relief to the morning
paper. Here&mdash;for the young writer was the
daughter of a prominent Bostonian&mdash;I saw
the announcement of her engagement to a
Chicago man, and I knew, of course, what ailed
the poetry; and I knew the medicine that I
should administer.</p>

<p>How far apart literature and life sometimes
get! And how much more real and romantic is
ordinary life than ordinary literature!</p>

<p>The girl was to meet me that afternoon in the
university extension lecture. The amphitheater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was full of city folk, and there in the middle of
the hall sat the young poet. She was very pretty,
one of the daughters of men still fair. Taking her
poem, I read it aloud to that last stanza, when,
turning sharply, and pointing the manuscript
hard at her, I demanded,</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this so? Do you want to leave Boston for
Fairyland, instead of Chicago? Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was staggered by the suddenness and
savageness of it all and rose to her feet, adorably
pink in her confusion, stammering, &#8220;No, no,
I beg&mdash;of course I&mdash;no, I don&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;by this
time so recovered that her eyes flashed wrath
as she dropped to her seat amid the gaping
and the twittering of the class.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mean it,&#8221; I demanded, &#8220;why
in the sacred name of literature did you write
it? Why don&#8217;t you ever write what you mean?
And you mean that Boston has suddenly become
a back number for literature; that the
literary center has shifted to Chicago&mdash;that&#8217;s
what you mean. Chicago! the one romantic,
fairy-like spot on earth! Isn&#8217;t that what you
mean? Then don&#8217;t you see how fresh, how
thrilling a theme you have in <i>your</i> Chicago?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
No one else, perhaps, ever saw Chicago in quite
this rosy, romantic light before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hers is the enduring truth about Chicago; as
against that set forth by Mr. Armour in &#8220;The
Packers, the Private Car Lines, and the People.&#8221;
Here she was, herself the very stuff of the eternal
in literature, and forced to Fairyland for something
to write about! Sheer nonsense. One need
not take the wings of the morning to the uttermost
sea, or make one&#8217;s bed in Hell for &#8220;copy.&#8221;
Chicago will do&mdash;or Boston&mdash;or even Hingham.</p>

<p>To be, if to be only a stock or a stone, beast
or bird or man, is to be a story, while to be any
one of my neighbors is to be an epic.</p>

<p>The day we moved out here, before our goods
arrived, a strangely youthful pair, far on in the
eighties, struggled up the hill from the old farm
below to greet us. He was clad in overalls and
topcoat, and she in flowers, overflowing from
both her arms, and in wild confusion on the
gayest Easter bonnet that ever bloomed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, neighbors!&#8221; she began,
extending her armfuls of glorious mountain
laurel; &#8220;Mr. White and I bring you the welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of the Hingham Hills&#8221;&mdash;Mr. White&#8217;s rough
old hand grasping mine amid the blossoms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the Hingham
Hills could hold such a welcome. I have tramped
the woods about here, but I never found a bunch
of laurel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you didn&#8217;t get into Valley Swamp! Mr.
White and I will show you, won&#8217;t we, Georgie?
We know where odes hang on hawthorns, don&#8217;t
we? We are busy farmers, and you know what
farming is; but we have never ploughed up our
poetry-patch, have we, Georgie?&#8221;</p>

<p>They never had; nor much of their other
ninety-six acres either&mdash;the whole farm a joyous
riot of free verse: fences without line or meter:
cattle running where they liked; the farm kit&mdash;a
mowing machine, a sulky plough, and a stolid
old grindstone&mdash;straying romantically about
the shy sweet fields.</p>

<p>It was an ode of a carriage that the spoony
old couple went to town in, with wheels dactylic
on one side and iambic on the other, and so
broken a line for a back spring that Mrs. White
would slide into Mr. White&#8217;s lap without cæsura
or even a punctuation mark to hinder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>I was at the village market one muddy March
day, when Cupid and the old mare, neither
wearing blinders, brought this chariot to the
curb. Mr. White, descending to the street,
reached up for Mrs. White, who, giving him
both her hands, put out a dainty foot to the
carriage-step and there poised, dismayed at the
March mud. Instantly Mr. White, disengaging
one hand, lifted a folded blanket from the seat,
shot it grandly out across the mud, and with a
bow as gallant as Sir Walter&#8217;s own, handed the
dear old shoes unblemished to the shop.</p>

<p>Eighteen or eighty, it is just the same. Boston
or Chicago or Hingham, it is just the same.
White or red or yellow or black, it is just the
same. The radium of romance is mixed with
the slag of all our souls. Here is my colored
neighbor down toward the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; I called to him over the telephone,
&#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to do that job for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>This neighbor is a most useful colored citizen,
with a complete line of avocations, cleaning cesspools
nocturnally and on Saturday afternoons
being one of these sporadic and subsidiary callings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he answered; &#8220;I most assuredly
am! And exceedingly sorry I am, too, for this
delay.&#8221; (He had been coming for one year and
six months now.) &#8220;But my business grows
enormously. It is really more than I can administer.
The fact is, professor, I must increase
my equipment. I can&#8217;t dip any longer. I am
rapidly approaching the proportions of a pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am rapidly approaching the proportions
of a pump.&#8221; Divine! I like the sound. For it
is the true measure of life as set over against
that which life may merely appear to be. To
trudge along through life beside your humble
cart of the long-handled dipper, and to know
that your dipper is approaching the proportions
of a pump is to know that you are greater than
you know.</p>

<p>I saw yesterday in the Sunday newspaper the
lovely face of a girl, who, &#8220;rumor has it,&#8221; ran
the legend, &#8220;will be the next Queen of England.&#8221;
She, too, like my colored neighbor, like us all, is
approaching the proportions of a pump. We
are all the stuff that pumps and dreams are
made of, and great art, and great literature.</p>

<p>I spoke of Joel Moore here in the next house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to me. For twenty-six years he was chained to
a milk-route, covering Lovell&#8217;s Corner, East
Weymouth, and our back wood-road; but he
always drove it in a trotting sulky.</p>

<p>From behind the bushes I have seen him
calming the leg-weary team as it labored up the
humps in the road, his feet braced, his arms extended
to the slack lines, his eyes fixed on the
Judge&#8217;s Stand ahead, while he maneuvered
against Ed Geers and Ben Hur and all the
Weymouths for the pole.</p>

<p>He came home in that lumbering, rattling
milk-cart as if it wore winged wheels, and were
being drawn by the steeds of Aurora around the
half-mile track at the great Brockton Fair.</p>

<p>It was sixteen years ago that Joel drove home
with Flora IV, a black mare without a leg to
stand on, but with a record of 2.12&frac34; There
was large fixing of the little barn for her, and
much rubbing-down of withers.</p>

<p>One day Joel was seen wandering over the
knoll here near the house, kicking stones around.
Something was the matter. I sauntered out
toward my barn casually and called to him.
Picking up a piece of rock in the pasture, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
staggered with it to the fence, and fixing it into
the wall, said with labored breath, &#8220;Flora IV
has a foal!&#8221; And, lifting another stone off the
wall, for ballast, he strode up the hill and over,
and down to his barn, not knowing the &#8220;Magnificat,&#8221;
it may be, but singing it in his heart all
the way down.</p>

<p>And this happened on the very hill which this
day I bought with the field by the side of the
house. Joel owned the field then. But he longed
for a fast horse. I never set my heart on a fast
horse; but I cannot resist a field. I did not
covet this field of Joel&#8217;s. I merely dreamed of
it as part of my dooryard, and waited&mdash;longer
than Jacob waited for Rachel. What a dream
she must have been!</p>

<p>But let me come back to Joel and Flora and
the foal.</p>

<p>My youngest boy was born that same summer&mdash;sixteen
years ago&mdash;the double event
in Joel&#8217;s mind wearing the mixed complexion
of twins. He had had no children till the colt
came, and naturally he spoiled her. She was
a willful little thing by inheritance, though&mdash;arch,
skittish, and very pretty; and long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
she wore shoes had got the petulant habit of
kicking the siding off the barn at any delay of
dinner.</p>

<p>She should have been broken by her second
birthday, but Joel would take no risks; and in
the third summer, though he &#8220;had her used to
leather,&#8221; he needed a steady old horse to hitch
her with, and she came up to her fourth birthday
untrained. Then, the first time he took her out,
she behaved so badly, and cut herself so, forward,
that it was necessary to turn her loose for
months. Then she was sent away to be broken,
but came back a little more willful than ever,
and prettier than ever, if possible.</p>

<p>That winter Joel had to give up his milk-route
on account of sickness, and with the opening
of spring got the blacksmith to take the colt
in hand. He took her, and threw her, dislocating
her shoulder. Then he pulled off her new shoes,
and she was put into the boxstall to get well.</p>

<p>After that, I don&#8217;t know just why, but we
talked of other things than the colt. She kicked
a board off the back of the barn one day, sending
a splinter whizzing past my head, but neither
of us noticed it. She was seven years old now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a creature shaped for speed, but Joel was not
strong enough to manage her, and a horse like
this could so easily be harmed. In fact, he never
harnessed her again.</p>

<p>I urged him from time to time, with what
directness I dared, to let me take him into the
hospital. But he had never left the farm and his
wife alone overnight in all these years. Then
one day he sent for me. He would go, he said,
if I could arrange for him.</p>

<p>A March snow lay on the fields the day before
he was to go, and all that day, at odd times,
I would see him creeping like a shadow about
his place: to the hen-coops, up to the line fence,
out to the apple tree in the meadow, taking a
last look at things. It was quite impossible for
me to work that day.</p>

<p>The next morning the four boys, on their way
to school, went down ahead of me to say good-bye.
They filed in, shook hands bravely, fighting
back their tears, and playing fine the game of
bluff with him, though the little fellow, born
the summer the colt was born, nearly spoiled
it all. He is a dear impulsive child and had
frankly been Joel&#8217;s favorite.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the eveners off the disk harrow,&#8221;
he was saying as he came out to the sleigh.
&#8220;I gave the kittens a bed of fresh rowan. I
drove a nail under the shutter of the can-house,
where you can hang the key. You had better
lock up a little till I get back&#8221;&mdash;his words half
muffled under the big robes of the sleigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to leave home,&#8221; he said, as we went
along; &#8220;but she couldn&#8217;t stand it. She&#8217;s not
well. It isn&#8217;t so bad for me with you along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two or three times he was about to say something
else, but felt too tired. I had him duly
entered; introduced him to his surgeon; helped
him to his cot, where a cheery nurse made him
easy; then gave him my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pay you
back some time. Only I can&#8217;t.&#8221; He clung a
moment longer to me. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had many
of the luxuries. I&#8217;ve worked hard for all I&#8217;ve
got&mdash;except for the little colt. She was thrown
in. I never fed her a quart of grain&mdash;the
cleanest little eater&mdash;as fat as butter&mdash;and on
nothing but roughage all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, looking me straight in the eye, he said
calmly, &#8220;You and I know and the doctors know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
But I couldn&#8217;t tell her. You tell her. You can.
And tell her I guess she had better sell the little
colt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment. Something yet he
wished to say&mdash;the thing he had tried before
to say. I hope the Recording Angel took it
down, and the <i>way</i> he said it, down. Not quite
daring to look into my eyes, he asked, wistfully,
&#8220;You don&#8217;t need a fast horse yourself, of course,
having your auto?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, Joel,&#8221; I answered firmly; &#8220;I do
need a fast horse. We all do, or something like
that.&#8221; And I bent over and kissed him, for his
wife, and for my little boy at home.</p>

<p>There is balm in Gilead; but are there racetracks
in Heaven?&mdash;and fast horses there?
Perhaps not. But I often wish that I had told
Joel I believed there were. Of course there are.
There is romance in Heaven, and the magical
chance of escape there.</p>

<small>THE HUNT FOR &#8220;COPY&#8221;</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> never was a bigger, fatter, flabbier
woodchuck than old Tubby&mdash;among wild
animals that I alone have known. Tubby is a
fixture of the farm. He was here when we came,
or else it was his father or his grandfather. He
is fat and flabby and as broad as he is long, and
broader when full of beans. He is very much
of a tub. When he sits in the garden, he sits
like a tub. When he runs, he runs like a tub.
And he holds beans like a tub.</p>

<p>It is worth a few beans to see him run&mdash;a
medley in motions: up and down and round
and round, the spinning of a top and the hop
of a saucepan on a hot stove with amazing
progress forward. He knows which end of him
is head and which tail; but from a distance I
can see neither head nor tail, only sides, bulging,
tubby sides spilling down the garden. One
seldom does see the ends of a thing from a distance.
Tubby has a head-end; and he has wits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in that end. He also has a tail-end; and the
disturbing conclusion one reaches with close
study is that Tubby has wits also in this end.
He is a beautifully capable thing in his way. A
cutworm is not more capable&mdash;if there is anything
so capable as a cutworm! Both are poems;
old Tubby an epic poem&mdash;were I as capable as
Tubby, and a Homer&mdash;</p>

<p>A full-sized woodchuck is twenty-two inches
long; and I presume that Tubby is not more
than twenty-two inches wide, though I have
seen him wobbling out of the garden and carrying
off as mere ballast a cabbage or two, and a
watermelon, and a peck or two of beans, and all
of the Swiss chard in the three rows. There are
several bushels of chard in three such rows.</p>

<p>The way he can run with his load! His little
black heels twinkling through the vines, his
shapeless carcass flopping into his hole with me
on top of him! Then I will hear a chuckling
deep down among the hickory roots, a peculiar
vegetarian chuckle quite unlike a carnivorous
growl. And then I will sit down on the hole and
chuckle, having lost for the moment my carnivorous
growl. He is so bold, so impudent, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
canny. The old scamp rather likes me. And
I am a fairly good gardener, if I do say it
myself.</p>

<p>When I place a trap in one entrance to his
burrow, he uses the other opening; if I put another
trap here, he promptly digs a passage
around it; if I block this with chunks of rock,
he undermines the stones and patiently moves
to a new house farther along the ridge; and, if
I set traps for him here, he changes house again.
It is a wide wooded ridge around the garden,
and honeycombed with woodchuck holes. By
and by he is back in his favorite house under
the hickory&mdash;when the spiders have hung the
doors with signs that the traps are gone.</p>

<p>But it happened once that I forgot the traps.
Wood-earth and bits of bark and dead leaves
washed down till the wicked gins were covered,
and Tubby, coming back after weeks off on the
ridge, tumbled into one of the traps and got his
thick fat fist fast. I heard him making a dreadful
racket, and rushed up with a club in my thick
fat fist.</p>

<p>Old Tubby stopped kicking and grunting,
and looked at me. I don&#8217;t believe that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ever looked at by a woodchuck before. Stolid,
sullen, defiant, there was much more of the
puzzled, of the world-old wonder in the eyes
gazing steadily into mine, as to what this
situation and this moment meant. The snarled
body was all fight and fear, but the blinking
eyes sought mine for an answer to the riddle
that I have asked of God. And all that I could
answer was, &#8220;You fat-head!&#8221; And he said,
&#8220;Fat-head yourself!&#8221; if ever a woodchuck
spoke, and spoke the truth. &#8220;Fat-head, to set
this rotten thing here and forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a rotten thing to do. Somehow he
made me feel as if I had trapped one of my
neighbors. He saw how I was feeling, and took
advantage of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose woods are these, anyway?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Whose ancestors were here first, yours or
mine? You didn&#8217;t even come over in the Mayflower.
But I came here in Noah&#8217;s Ark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. But keep quiet,&#8221; I begged him,
&#8220;and stop looking at me that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What way?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so much like my brother!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;But I am your brother,&#8221; he retorted,
&#8220;though I am ashamed to say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it, then,&#8221; I begged.</p>

<p>But he was wound up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any man who is brute enough to set this
sort of thing for his brother has no soul. And
any man who can&#8217;t share his beans with his
brother doesn&#8217;t deserve a soul. If I were as
low-down and as lazy as you, I would go over
to the north side of this hill and dig a deep hole,
and crawl into it, and pull it in on top of me,
I would.&#8221; And all the time I was pressing down
on the spring with my club, trying to free him.
Suddenly there was a flop in the hole, and away
in the sub-cellar, among the hickory roots, there
was talk of me which I should have heard, had
I been able to understand.</p>

<p>But I have much to learn. And so has Pup,
our Scotch-Irish terrier. Time and time again
Pup has sent the old woodchuck tumbling over
himself for his hole. Once or twice they have
come to blows at the mouth of the burrow, and
Pup has come off with a limp or a hurt ear, but
with only a mouthful of coarse reddish hair to
growl over. He came off with a deep experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
lately, and a greatly enhanced respect for woodchucks.
But he is of stubborn stock. So is
Tubby of stubborn stock. Pup knows that here
is an enemy of the people, and that he must
get him. He knows that Tubby is all hair and
hide and bowels. He now knows that Tubby is
deeper than he is broad, which makes him
pretty deep.</p>

<p>The new light began to dawn on Pup when
Tubby moved up from the woods to a corner
of the ice-house near the barn. The impudence,
the audacity of the thing stood Pup&#8217;s hair on
end, and he took to the blackberry-vines at the
other corner of the ice-house to see what would
happen.</p>

<p>Tubby&#8217;s raiding hour was about five in the
afternoon. At that hour the shadows of the
ice-house and the barn lay wide across the
mowing-field&mdash;the proper time and color for
things to happen. And there in the close-cut
field, as if he had come up out of a burrow, sat
old Tubby, looking as big as a bear!</p>

<p>Pup stole softly out to meet him, moving
over till he was between the chuck and the ice-house
hole. It was a deliberate act and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
complete abandon. Things must this time be
finished. And what a perfect bit of strategy it
was! Hugging the ground when the chuck rose
high on his haunches to reconnoiter, Pup would
&#8220;freeze&#8221; till Tubby dropped down and went to
feeding, then, gliding like a snake forward, he
would flatten behind a stone or a tuft of grass,
and work forward and wait.</p>

<p>The ground rose slightly to Pup&#8217;s disadvantage,
and he was maneuvering to avoid the uphill
rush when Tubby heard something off in the
woods and turned with a dash for his hole. It
was head-on and terrific! And the utter shock
of it, the moral shock, was more terrific! Neither
knew for an instant just what had happened;
the suddenness, the precision, the amazing
boldness and quality of the attack putting Pup
almost out of action. But it was precisely the
jar old Tubby needed. Every flabby fiber of
him was fight. The stub feet snapped into
action; the chunk of a body shot forward, ramming
Pup amidships, sending him to the bottom
of the slope, Tubby slashing like a pirate
with his terrible incisors.</p>

<p>But the touch of those long teeth brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Pup short about. He likes the taste of pain.
He is a son of battle. And in a moment like this
he is possessed of more than common powers
of body and soul. The fur flew; the grass flew;
but there was scarcely a sound as the two
fighters tumbled and tossed a single black-brown
body like a ball of pain. They sprang apart
and together again, whirled and dived and
dodged as they closed, each trying for a hold
which neither dared allow. But Pup got plenty
of hair, choking, slippery hair, and leathery
hide by the mouthful, while the twisting, snapping
woodchuck cut holes in Pup&#8217;s thin skin
with teeth which would punch holes in sheet
steel.</p>

<p>And Tubby was fighting with his head as well
as with teeth and toes. He was cooler than
Pup. He had a single-track mind, and it ran
straight to his burrow. The head-work was
perfectly clear; the whole powerful play going
forward with the nicest calculation, mad as it
appeared to be in the wild rough-and-tumble.
There was method in Tubby&#8217;s madness. He was
fighting true to plan. But Pup was fighting to
kill, and he lost his head. It was to win his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hole, and life, and the pursuit of happiness on
these ancestral acres that the woodchuck was
fighting; and, as the two laid about them and
rolled over and over, they kept rolling nearer
and nearer to the ice-house and a burrow under
the corner.</p>

<p>Over and over, right and left, they lunged
when the woodchuck, sent spinning from Pup&#8217;s
foreleg, came up with the dog chopping at his
stub nose, but, giving him all four of his mailed
feet instead, he bounded from the face of the
dog, and, with a lightning somersault, landed
plop in his burrow, Pup raking the hair from the
vanishing haunch.</p>

<p>And now Pup knows that there is no bottom
to a woodchuck&#8217;s burrow. But do I fully realize
that there is no bottom to the woodchuck? I
have been almost fatally slow over this lesson.
Yet this is the writer&#8217;s first and most important
lesson, no matter what his theme.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been studying the woodchuck all my
life,&#8221; said my old friend Burroughs to me, &#8220;and
there is no getting to the bottom of him!&#8221; He
made that great discovery early; eighty-four
years of study confirmed it; and from early to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
late Burroughs never lacked for things to write
about or failed of his urge to write. There was
no bottom to his woodchuck.</p>

<p>Others have made this discovery concerning
other things: the philosophers, of truth; the
poets, of men and flowers; the prophets, of
God. But the writer must find it true of all
things, of all his own things, from woodchucks
to God. There is nothing new in this discovery.
It simply makes all things new to the discoverer.
The skeptical, the shallow, the fool who says
in his heart there is nothing but bowels to a
woodchuck&mdash;what would he at four-and-eighty
find at Woodchuck Lodge to write about?
He might have all knowledge and a pen with
which he could remove mountains, but, lacking
wonder, that power to invest things with new
and infinite significance, he would see no use in
removing the mountains and turning them
into steppes and pampas and peopled plains.</p>

<p>All creative work, whether by brush or pen or
hoe, is somehow making mountains into men,
out of the dust an image, in our own likeness
created, in the likeness of God. It may be
woodchuck dust, or dandelion dust, or the shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dust of stars; touched with a creative, interpreting
pen the dust takes human shape and
breathes a breath divine. A woodchuck pelt
makes an excellent fur for a winter coat; the
rest of him makes an excellent roast for a dinner;
but it is what still remains, the wonder of him,
which makes for sermon and for song.</p>

<p>How hard a lesson that has been for me to
learn! And so slow have I been learning it that
little time is left for me to preach or sing. If only
I had known early that Mullein Hill was as good
as Helicon; that the people of Hingham were
as interesting as the people of Cranford; that
Hingham has a natural history as rich and
as varied as Selborne! My very friends have
helped to mislead and hinder me: &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
what you find to write about up here!&#8221; they
exclaim, looking out with commiseration over
the landscape, as if Wellfleet or Washington or
Wausau were better for books than Hingham!
Hanover may be better for ducks than Scituate;
but Hingham is as good as Hanover or Heaven
for books.</p>

<p>One of my friends started for Hanover once for
a day of hunting&mdash;but I will let him tell the story:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;We were on our way to Hanover, duck
hunting,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and at Assinippi took the
left fork of the road and kept going. But was
this left fork the right road? [An ancient doubt
which had brought many a traveler before them
to confusion and a halt.] It was early morning,
raw and dark and damp. No one was stirring
in the farmhouses straggling along the road,
and we were turning to go back to the forks
when the kitchen door of the near-by house
opened and a gray-bearded man appeared with
a milk-pail on his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is this the road to Hanover?&#8217; we called.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man backed into the kitchen door, put
down his milk-pail, came out again, carefully
closing the door behind him, and started down
the walk toward the front gate. He opened
the gate, turned and latched it behind him as
carefully as he had latched the kitchen door,
and, stepping out into the road, approached our
carryall. Looking up, then down the road intently,
he hitched his right foot to the hub of
our front wheel, spat precisely into the dust,
and, fixing his face steadfastly toward Cape
Cod, answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Say it with flowers!&#8217; snapped our driver,
wheeling about for the other fork.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the turn I looked back. There stood our
guide in the road, his right foot still in the air,
I think; and there&mdash;though it is several years
since, he may still be standing&mdash;one foot
planted on the road to Scituate, the other foot
resting on the hub of the wheel that should have
been on the road to Hanover.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man in the road knew that this road ran
to Scituate. He lived on it. Had they asked
him: &#8220;Master, which is the Great Commandment?&#8221;
he had answered: &#8220;Take this road for
Scituate.&#8221; For were they not duck hunting in
Hanover? Then what profounder error could
they have been in than on the road to Scituate!</p>

<p>But most people go that way for Hanover.
Every young writer I know hankers to get his
Hanover ducks out of Scituate, as if, failing to
get ducks, he might get Scituate; novelty, the
mere novelty of gunning in Scituate when the
ducks are in Hanover, making the best sort of
&#8220;copy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Is it some new thing that we should search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
out, or some deeper, truer thing? Must we
travel, or may we stay at home? Locomotion is
certainly a curse to literature. No one nowadays
stays long enough in his own place to know it
and himself in it, which is about all that he can
know well enough to express. Let the writer
stay at home. Drummers, actors, circus-men,
and Satan are free to go up and down the earth.
And these seem to be writing most of our books.</p>

<p>For some years, now, I, also, have been going
to and fro and up and down in the earth thinking
that I might find some better place than Hingham.
I have just returned from Wausau,
Wisconsin, where they have a very hard red
granite, and a deep green granite, both of them
the loveliest tombstone stuff that, I think, I
ever saw. Certainly they are superior to our
seam-face Hingham granite for tombstones.
Up to the time of my Wausau visit, I had never
given much thought to tombstones; but it shows
how one&#8217;s thought expands with travel, and
how easily Wausau may surpass Hingham, not
alone in gravestones, but in other, even in literary,
materials.</p>

<p>But Hingham has one thing in the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
gravestones not found at all in Wausau: I mean
the boulders, great roundish glacial boulders,
gray granite boulders, old and gentle and mossy-grown,
which lie strewn over our hilly pastures
among the roses and the hardhack and the
sweetfern, ready to be rolled to the tomb, and
fit for any poet&#8217;s tomb. When that shy spirit
and bird-lover, Bradford Torrey, native of my
neighbor town of Weymouth, died in far-off
California, he left but a single simple request:
that he be brought back to his birthplace for
burial, and that a Weymouth boulder be found
and rolled up to mark his grave. Were mine not
Hingham boulders I would take one out of my
wall, the one which serves as a gatepost, and,
with a yoke of Weymouth oxen, would draw it
to Bradford Torrey&#8217;s tomb, a tribute from
Hingham to Weymouth, and a gift out of the
heart of one who knows and loves &#8220;The Foot-Path
Way,&#8221; &#8220;A Rambler&#8217;s Lease,&#8221; and &#8220;A
World of Green Hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps one must needs go to California in
order to come by this deep desire for Weymouth.
Then let him go early. For if he is to write &#8220;The
Natural History of Weymouth,&#8221; or of Selborne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he must return early and stay a long time.
Thoreau has been criticized for writing of
Nature as if she were born and brought up in
Concord. So she was. Can one not see all of the
world out of the &#8220;Window in Thrums&#8221;?&mdash;that
is, all of the world of Thrums, which is all of the
world, and just the world, one goes to Thrums
to see? &#8220;I have traveled a great deal in Concord,&#8221;
says Thoreau.</p>

<p>This brings me back to Hingham. I wish that
I could write &#8220;The Natural History of Hingham&#8221;!
A modest desire! There can never be
another Gilbert White&mdash;but not for lack of
birds and beasts in Hingham. Were I a novelist
I would write a &#8220;Cranford&#8221;&mdash;and I could! I
would call it &#8220;Hingham,&#8221; not &#8220;Main Street,&#8221;
though that is the name of perhaps the longest
street in Hingham. But there are many other
streets in Hingham, and all kinds of interesting
people.</p>

<p>And here I am on Mullein Hill, Hingham,
with all of these streets, and all of these people,
and woodchucks a plenty to write about&mdash;and
planning this day a trip to California! I might
have been the author of a recent book whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
theme and sub-title read: &#8220;In the plains and the
rolling country there is room for the individual
to skip and frolic, but all the peaks are preëmpted.&#8221;
Come down from Mullein Hill; get
out of Hingham; go West, young writer, as far
as California; you shall find room to skip and
frolic on the plains out there!</p>

<p>It may be true in California, but the opposite
of that is true in Hingham. To be sure, I have
tried to preëmpt Mullein Hill; I now own the
knoll outside my study window, and the seven-acre
woodlot beyond; but there are many other
peaks here among the hills of Hingham, and
scarcely any of them occupied. The people of
Hingham all crowd into the plains. So did the
people of Israel crowd into the plains&mdash;of
Moab, leaving Pisgah to Moses, who found it
very lonesome. There is no one on Pisgah now,
I understand; no one on Ararat; no one on
Popocatepetl; no one on the top of Vesuvius,
nor on the peak of Everest, peaks as well known
as White Plains or the Plains of Abraham, but
not anything like so crowded. Moses sleeps on
Nebo, yet no man knows where he lies. Have
them lay you in Sleepy Hollow if you wish your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
friends and neighbors to crowd in close and
keep you company.</p>

<p>Why has there been no Iliad of Hingham?
There are Helens in Hingham, as there were
Helens of Troy. Hingham is short of Homers.
Mute, inglorious Miltons have we in Hingham.
If one of them, however, should take his pen
in hand, would he dream, and if he dreamed,
would he dare to cry to the Heavenly Muse,</p>

<p>Which of our poets thinks any more of an
adventurous song? Of attempting any more the
unattempted in either prose or rhyme? It is as
if everything had been attempted; everything
dared; everything accomplished&mdash;the peaks
all preëmpted. Politics or religion or literature,
it matters not: the great days are gone, the
great things are done, the great men securely
housed in the Hall of Fame. Heaven offers us
a League of Nations and we prefer the tried and
proved device of war; a famed evangelist comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to town, we build him a vast tabernacle, and
twenty thousand gather for the quickening
message&mdash;&#8220;Brighten the corner where you
are!&#8221; And in the corners, and over the walls
of the nation, with poster and placard the
&#8220;Safety-First&#8221; sign warns us not to hold our
little rushlight over-high, or flare it over-far,
for fear we set our brightened corner of the
world on fire. But the whole world is on fire!
And wherever an emperor has escaped the devouring
flame, he is fiddling, as emperors do;
and his poet laureate is writing free verse; and
all of his faithful subjects are saying, over and
over, &#8220;Day by day, in every way, I am getting
better and better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are taught by great actions that the
universe is the property of every individual in
it,&#8221; says Emerson. &#8220;Every rational creature
has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is
his, if he will. He may divest himself of it; he
may creep into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom,
as most men do, but he is entitled to the
world by his constitution.&#8221; I have not spoken
lately with a man who seemed to think he was
entitled to the world. That grand old faith has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
passed away. But I talk with no man lately
who does not think he is entitled to an automobile.
Great is Tin Lizzie of the Americans!
Greater than Diana of the Ephesians. But
except for our worship of the Ford we are not
over-religious. The Ford is a useful little deity;
she meets our needs to the last mile. The individual
can skip and frolic with her, for she is
distinctly the goddess of the plains and rolling
country. Admirable to her winking tail-light,
she is one hundred per cent American, the work
of one of the supreme inventive geniuses of our
time. She is the greatest thing in America, chugging
everywhere but up Parnassus. Fool-proof,
the universal car, she is the very sign and symbol
of our antlike industry, the motor-minded expression
of our internal-combustion age.</p>

<p>Even my quiet old friend Burroughs had his
Ford. It was her creator himself who gave her
to him. The creature would climb around the
slopes and over the walls about Woodchuck
Lodge like a side-hill gouger, Burroughs in his
long white beard driving her, as Father Time
might drive a merry-go-round. He nearly lost
his life in her, too. But everybody nearly loses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
his life so nowadays; and nearly everybody had
rather lose his life in a Ford than to drag out an
endless existence in a buggy or on foot or in a
wooden swing at home, watching the Fords go
by. What is life, anyway? The Ford is cheap;
the service station is everywhere; so, pile into the
little old &#8220;bug&#8221;&mdash;on the hood and running-boards!
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps our machines are taking us&mdash;we
wish to believe so&mdash;to some new Arden, some
far-off Avalon, where we shall heal us of our
motor-minds, our movie-nerves, our corner-light
religion; where &#8220;Safety First&#8221; shall give
place to &#8220;Derring-Do&#8221; as a national motto;
where we shall ascend the empty peaks, and out
of the thunder and smoke of shaking Sinai bring
down some daring commandment, done by the
finger of God on new tables of stone.</p>

<p>We are not lacking courage. It is imagination
that we lack. We dare. But we do not think
it worth while. We are shallow, skeptical, conventional,
out of tune with the Infinite, and out
of touch with spiritual things. If we do not try
the unattempted, it is because we believe it has
already been tried. It is because Homer has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
preëmpted Helicon that we tunnel it. Only
Milton, among us moderns (and how ancient
Milton seems!), only Milton in his blindness has
seen that there is room and verge enough on
Helicon, and deeps within the abyss of Hades
where Dante would be lost. No, Milton is not
the only modern to leave the plains, and, like a
star, to dwell apart. Thoreau did it at Walden;
Lanier did it on the marshes of Glynn; Burroughs
did it at Woodchuck Lodge; and Hudson did it
on the plains of Patagonia&mdash;proof enough that
ponds and plains and the low-lying marsh may
be as high as Helicon for poetry, if only the poet
have the vision to see that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Like to the greatness of God is the greatness within</div>
<div class="verse">The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But here we fail. We no longer see the greatness
of God in things. We have covered God
with an atom. We ask for bread, and Science
gives us a stone; for God, and Science gives us
an electron. It was a super-electron that created
the heavens and the earth when it saw that all
of the other electrons were without form and
void. Atomism has taken the place of theism
in our religion, if it is religion. Man is only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bunch of willful atoms, or parts of atoms, not
any longer the crowning work of Creation, its
center and circumference, its dominion and
destiny and glory, its divine expression, interpretation,
and immortal soul. Are we to be
robbed of God? Inhibited forever from faith by
the lensed eyes of Science?</p>

<p>&#8220;What is man?&#8221; I ask, and Science laughs
and answers, &#8220;Electrons.&#8221; That is its latest
guess. But does man look like them? Does he
feel like them? Does he behave like them?
Does he believe like them? In the laboratory he
may. But out here in the hills of Hingham,
where I am returned to the earth and the sky
and to my own soul, I know that I AM, and
that I still hold to all of those first things which
Science would shame me out of, offering me
electrons instead!</p>

<p>I accept the electrons. Capering little deities,
they are the sons of God. But so are you and I
the sons of God&mdash;and we are electrons, trillions
of electrons, if you like.</p>

<p>Gods and atoms, we can dwell and think and
feel as either, the two realms distinct and far
apart, the roads between in a continual state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of construction, dangerous but passable. The
anatomist, laying down his scalpel, cries, &#8220;Such
knowledge is too wonderful for me. I am fearfully
and wonderfully made!&#8221;&mdash;his science passing
into poetry, and from poetry to religion,
but not easily in our present frame and mood.</p>

<p>Science clears the sight and widens its range;
but Science can never clear up the shadows at the
bottom of a woodchuck. Only vision can do
that, and Science lacks vision, using a microtome
instead, paring its woodchuck till he is
thinner than sliced sunlight before it can see
through so much as a single stained cell of him.
Science turns aside from shadows, walking by
sight or else standing still. It deals with the
flesh, not the spirit; and is as impotent in literature
and art as in life and society. The potent
thing among men and nations is love. Love
never faileth. Yet never were we so afraid of
love as we are to-day; and never did art and
literature seem so fearful of the imagination, of
vision, of the eternal, the divine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go get me a bird,&#8221; the old scientist said to
me; &#8220;I will give you a lesson in skinning and
mounting.&#8221; I was a young boy. Hurrying out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to the woods, I was soon back with a cuckoo.
The face of the old scientist darkened. &#8220;You
should not have killed this bird, it is the friend
of man. See when I open this gizzard.&#8221; And
with a dexterous twist of his fingers turned inside
out the gizzard, and showed it, like a piece
of plush, its fleshy walls penetrated with millions
of caterpillar hairs.</p>

<p>To this day I feel the wonder of that knowledge,
and I thrill at the meaning of that bird&#8217;s
gizzard. Here was science and charity and
poetry and religion. What untold good to man!
What greater possible good to man? That was
before I knew or understood the cuckoo&#8217;s song.
And neither the old scientist, nor yet his book,
&#8220;Sixteen Weeks in Zoölogy,&#8221; dealt with the
song. Science is sure and beautiful with a gizzard.
Poetry is sure and beautiful with both
gizzard and song. And I wonder if the grinding
gizzard or the singing throat is the better part
of the cuckoo, even in this world of worms?</p>

<p>I have a great book, published by the Government,
devoted entirely to birds&#8217; gizzards, mills
of the gods, and their grindings. It is not a dull
book, though the mills grind slowly and grind
exceeding small. It is a book of bones, of broken
beetles, seeds, hairs, feathers, and fragments.
It is a great work of science. One might not
like to lay it down unfinished; but, having
finished it, one could hardly say:</p>

<p>Nature will not do, nor all the truth of nature,
for stuff of song and story. As life is more than
meat, so is literature more than life. Nature
conforms to art; and in fiction &#8220;the only real
people are those who never existed.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Good-Will Farm, Maine, there is a rock
marked with a copper plate. It had been marked
for drill and dynamite, until, one day, my car
swung up and over a sharp turn in the road
before the schoolhouse, skidding rather horribly
on the smooth outcropping ledge which had
been uncovered and left as part of the roadbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to blast that thing out,&#8221; I said,
somewhat testily, to the supervisor who came
out to greet me, my nerves, strung a bit too
tight on the long day&#8217;s drive, snapping with the
skid here at the very end of the trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he replied, apologetically. &#8220;I
had intended to do it from the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day we were climbing this road on
foot, and, standing on the ledge to take in the
wide landscape of the Kennebec below us, I
chanced to look down at my feet and saw, cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
deep in the smooth surface of the stone, several
parallel lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blast out this rock!&#8221; I exclaimed.
&#8220;Tear down your schoolhouse rather. Build a
new road through the grounds, but leave this
stone. This is part of a great book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said the supervisor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is written a page of the greatest story
ever penned. These lines were done by the hand
of the glacier who came this way in the Ice Age.
Don&#8217;t blot it out. Put a fence about it, and a
copper plate upon it, translating the story so
that your students can read it and understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did. There was no need of the fence; but
he set the plate into the rock, telling of the Ice
Age, how the glacier came down, ploughing
out the valley of the Kennebec, rounding and
smoothing this ledge, and inditing this manuscript
for Good-Will Farm School ages later.</p>

<p>So much does the mere scratch of science
enhance the virtue of a stone! Now add to your
science history. Instead of the scratch of a
glacier, let it be a chisel and a human hand,
and let the marks be&mdash;&#8220;1620.&#8221; Now read&mdash;if
you can read and understand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>I copy it verbatim from a Freshman college
theme:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plymouth Rock</span></p>

<p>Plymouth Rock is situated in Plymouth Mass. It
is the rock upon which the Mayflower landed in
1620. But it is not now where it was then. It was
moved many years ago up to the street. And when
they moved it it broke. But they cemented it together.
It is four or five feet long; and three or four
feet wide; and it is inscribed with the famous figures
1620, to celebrate the landing of the Puritans at that
time. It is enclosed within a canopy of stone and an
iron fence; but the gate is hardly ever closed. There
are a great many famous stones in the world but this
is as famous as any.</p></blockquote>

<p>My mother was visiting me. She is a self-contained
old Quaker, and this was the second
time in all of her eighty years that she had even
seen New England! What should we do first?
What did she most desire to see? &#8220;Take me to
see Plymouth Rock first,&#8221; she said; and we
were off, mother as excited and as lively as a
girl. As we entered Plymouth, however, I
noticed that mother had grown silent, and that
her doctor-daughter, beside her on the back seat,
always sensitive to her moods, was also silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
We descended the hill to the harbor, came on
in sight of the canopy over the Rock, and slowed
down to stop. But the car had not stopped,
when mother, the back door open, her foot on
the running-board, was stepping off and through
the open gate, where, falling on her knees, with
tears running down her face, she kissed the
blessed stone, her daughter calling, &#8220;O Mother,
the germs! the germs!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Science and Religion thus clash, Science
must give way. Mother knew as much about
germs as her doctor-daughter. She had lived
longer than her daughter; she had lost more,
and had loved more&mdash;some things more than
life itself.</p>

<p>Science has marked every rock; but only
those that are wet with such tears and kissed
with such lips are ripe for sermon and song.
These are the eyes and these the lips of those,
who, passing through Bacca, make it a well.
Knowledge alone, though it course the very
heavens, will come back to earth without so
much as one shining fleck of stardust in its hair.</p>

<p>The other day a great astronomer was delivering
a lecture in Boston on the stars. Wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and awe held the audience as it traveled the
stellar spaces with the help of the astounding
pictures on the screen. The emotion was deep;
the tension almost painful as the lecturer swept
on and on through the unthinkable vast, when,
coming to his close, he turned and asked lightly,
&#8220;Now, what do you think of immortality? Is
it anything more than the neurotic hope of a
very insignificant mote in this immensity?&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect was terrific. The scientific smiled.
The simple left the hall dazed and stunned.
They lost all sense of time and space, they lost
sight of the very stars in this swift, far fall.
They had been carried up through the seven
spheres to the very gate of heaven, then hurled
to earth. The lecture failed&mdash;not of instruction,
not of emotion, but of will, leaving the
listeners powerless and undone. The lecturer
may be right&mdash;for astronomy; and yet be
quite wrong, for poetry. He may have uttered
the last word&mdash;for science; but this end is only
the beginning for religion.</p>

<p>How much greater an astronomer this college
professor than that shepherd psalmist on the far-off
Syrian hills! Ranging the same astral field as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
our scientist, sweeping the same stellar spaces,
with only a shepherd&#8217;s knowledge, the psalmist&#8217;s
thought takes the same turn as the scientist&#8217;s,
down to man, but on different wings,&mdash;the
wings of poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;When I consider thy heavens,</div>
<div class="verse">The work of thy fingers,</div>
<div class="verse">The moon and the stars</div>
<div class="verse">Which thou hast ordained;</div>
<div class="verse">What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</div>
<div class="verse">And the son of man, that thou visitest him?&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then, swinging upward on those mighty wings,
past the reach of science, out of the range of
knowledge, up, up to the divinest height ever
touched by human thought, the psalmist-astronomer
cries impiously, exultantly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;For thou hast made him but little lower than God,</div>
<div class="verse">And crownest him with glory and honor!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This starts where the astronomer stopped. This
is religion and literature. And I have these
very stars over my hilltop here in Hingham!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE DUTY TO DIG</small></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A young</span> man sat by the roadside, milking. And
as he milked, one drove up in her limousine and
stopped and said unto him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man, why are you not at the front?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man milked on, for that was the
thing to do. Then, with still more slackers in
her voice, the woman said a second time unto
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man, why are you not at the front?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, ma&#8217;am, the milk is at this end,&#8221;
he answered.</p>

<p>And the chauffeur, throwing the clutch of
the limousine into third speed ahead, drove off,
thinking.</p>

<p>But the young man milking had already
thought. To milk is to think. If &#8220;darning is
premeditated poverty,&#8221; then there is no saner
occupation for human hands, none more thought-inducing,
unless it be milking. Anyhow, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Great War came on, I went over to a neighbor&#8217;s
and bought a cow; I made me a new
milking-stool with spread sturdy legs; and I
sat down to face the situation calmly, where
I might see it steadily and whole. I had tried
the professorial chair; I had tried the editorial
chair; I had even tried that Siege Perilous, the
high-backed, soft-seated chair of plush behind
the pulpit. I may never preach again; but if I
do, it will be on condition that I sit on a three-legged
milking stool instead of on that upholstered
pillowy throne of plush.</p>

<p>Whence cometh wisdom? and where is the
place of understanding? The flaming flambeaux
on the Public Library say, &#8220;The light is in here&#8221;;
the &Phi; B K key in the middle of the professorial
waistcoat says, &#8220;It is in here.&#8221; But I say, let
the flambeaux be replaced by round-headed
stocking-darners, as the sign of premeditated
poverty; and the dangling Key by a miniature
milking-stool, as the symbol of the wisdom that
knows which end of a cow to milk.</p>

<p>Not one of those students in the University
who earned &Phi; B K last year knew how to milk,
and only a few, I believe, of their professors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
One of these, with a Ph.D. from Germany, whose
key had charmed his students across their whole
college course, asked me what breed of cattle
heifers were. Might not his teaching have been
quite as practical, had there dangled from his
watch-chain those four years, not this key to
the catacombs of knowledge, but a little jeweled
milking-stool?</p>

<p>I too might wear a key, especially as I came
innocently by mine, having had one <i>thrust</i> upon
me; still, as I was born on a farm, and grew up
in the fields, and am likely to end my days as I
have lived them, here in the woods, this &Phi; B K
key does not fit the lock to the door of knowledge
that opens widest to me.</p>

<p>I have read a little on the aorist tense, and on
the Ygdrasyl tree; a little, I say, on many things,
from the animal aardvark, here and there, to
zythum, a soft drink of the ancient Egyptians,
picking a few rusty locks with this skeleton key;
but the doors that open wide at my approach
are those to my house, my barn, and the unwithholding
fields. I know the road home, clear
to the end; I know profoundly to come in when
it rains; and I move with absolute certainty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the right end of the cow when it is time to
milk.</p>

<p>I am aware of a certain arrogance in this, a
show of pride, and that unbottomed pomp of
those who wear the &Phi; B K key dangling at their
vests,&mdash;as if I could milk <i>any</i> cow! or might
have in my barn the world&#8217;s champion cow! I
have only a grade Jersey in my barn; and as for
milking heifers with their first calves&mdash;I <i>have</i>
milked them. But breaking in a heifer is really
a young man&#8217;s job.</p>

<p>So I find myself at the middle of my years,
stripped of outward signs, as I hope I am inwardly
purged, of all vain shows of wisdom
(quite too humble, truly!), falling in as unnaturally
as the birds with the fool daylight-saving
plan, the ways of the sun, who knoweth
his going down, being quite good enough for me.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> how far run the ways of nature from the
devious ways of men! The ways of Mullein Hill
from the ways of a military camp! The Great
War came and passed and left the earth a vast
human grave. But through it all seedtime and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
harvest came to Mullein Hill, leaving only more
and more abundant life. The Great War is an
illustration on the grandest scale of what man,
departing from the simple ways of nature, will
do to man. War is the logic of our present way
of living. I am not concerned with war in this
book, but with the sources of life and literature.
I have a cure for war, however, here on Mullein
Hill; and this cure is the very elixir of life and
literature.</p>

<p>War could have destroyed, but it did not
change, my going or coming here in the hills.
My garden went on as it had for years gone on.
There was a little more of it, for there was more
need in the village; there was a little larger yield
of its reasonableness and joy and beans. But I
did not plough up my front lawn for potatoes.
Years before I had provided myself with a back
yard, and got it into tilth for potatoes, keeping
the front lawn green for the cow.</p>

<p>Though she is only a grade Jersey, the cow is
a pretty creature, and gives a rural, ruminant
touch to our approach, along with the lilacs and
the hens. Hitched here on the front lawn the
cow suggests economy, too. She is more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a wagon hitched to a star. She is a mowing-machine,
and a rake and tedder, and a churn.
The gods with her do my mowing, gather up
and cure my hay, and turn it into cream.</p>

<p>Every cow gives some skim milk&mdash;which we
need for the chickens, for cooking, and cottage
cheese. Life is not all cream. If I speak of gods
doing my chores, I will say they do not milk
for me in the mornings, and that it is one of the
boys who milks at night. A cow clipping your
lawn is poetry and cream too, but caring for the
creature is often skim milk and prose. Milking
ought to be done regularly. Get a cow and you
find her cud a kind of pendulum to all creation,
the time to milk being synchronized twice daily
to the stars.</p>

<p>I did not plant war-potatoes on my front lawn,
partly because they would not grow there, and
partly because, in times of peace, I had prepared
for war-potatoes; and partly because I
think a front lawn looks better in cows than in
potatoes. If thou shouldst</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;So live, that when thy summons comes to join</div>
<div class="verse">The innumerable caravan ...</div>
<div class="verse">Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,</div>
<div class="verse">Scourged to his dungeon,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&mdash;should we not all live so that, when war
comes, we need not plough up the beds for potatoes
where the portulaca and poppy ought to
blow?</p>

<p>But what a confession here! When war
comes! As if I expected war to come again!
Many of us are fighting feebly against both the
thought and the hideous thing. But many more
are preparing for it. Our generals of the late war
are going up and down the land preaching preparedness,
as they always have. We learn nothing.
They know everything. Their profession
is war. Can a man lay down his life for a profession
he does not believe in? The military men
believe in war.</p>

<p>But so do we all as a people. War is the oldest,
most honored profession in the world. In all
of the fifty years of its history, the great University,
of which, for almost half of that time,
I have been a teacher, had never conferred an
honorary degree. For fifty years it had carried
a single laurel wreath in its hand to crown some
honored head. Prophets came and went; poets
came and went; scientists came and went;
scholars came and went; but still the University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
dedicated to life and learning, waited
with its single wreath a yet more honorable
brow.</p>

<p>Then came Foch, the professional soldier.
Study for nearly ten thousand students was
suspended; a holiday was proclaimed; a great
assembly was called; and here, with speech and
song and academic garb, with national colors
mingling and waving palms, the laurel wreath
was placed upon the soldier&#8217;s brow. And this
University, founded in the name of the Prince
of Peace, dedicated to Christian life and learning,
crowned the profession of arms as it can
crown no other profession, and gave its highest
sanction to bloody war.</p>

<p>I do not fail of gratitude to Foch. I only
stand in horror that he is, and had to be. I
would have had the Nation at the pier to meet
him, but clothed in sackcloth, and every citizen
with ashes on his head. I, too, would have
suspended study and work everywhere for an
hour; and, stretching crape across the Arctic
Circle till the sign of mourning hid Matamoras
and Cape Sable, I would have called an assembly
of the continent, and begged this half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hemisphere to cry, &#8220;O God, the foolishness and
futility of war!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duty to Dig is older than the practice
of war. It was designed to prevent war; and
to-day it is the only biological remedy certain
to cure war. I must not stop here to explain
its therapeutics as applied to war, for I am
dealing with another theme. But just before
the war broke upon the world, I wrote an
editorial for a paper I was serving, advocating
that a hive of my bees be sent to the German
Emperor and one also to the war lord of Austria.
I had extra hives for the British Prime Minister,
the Tiger of France, Mr. William Randolph
Hearst, and Mr. Theodore Roosevelt. If I
could have interested these gentlemen, and a
few others, in bee-keeping, I could save the
world from war.</p>

<p>The editorial and the offer of bees were both
rejected by the careful editor. &#8220;I must stay
strictly neutral,&#8221; was his timid excuse. At the
very time I was writing, the Reverend Price
Collier, a former Hingham preacher, was publishing
a book called &#8220;Germany and the Germans,&#8221;
in which he set forth the old theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
military preparedness as a preventive of war.
Speaking of the German army (this was in
1913), he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the best all-round democratic university in the
world; it is a necessary antidote for the physical lethargy
of the German race; it is essential to discipline;
it is a cement for holding Germany together; it gives
a much-worried and many-times-beaten people confidence;
the poverty of the great bulk of its officers
keeps the level of social expenditure on a sensible
scale; it offers a brilliant example, in a material age,
of men scorning ease for the service of their country;
it keeps the peace in Europe; and until there is a
second coming of a Christ of pity and patience and
peace, it is as good a substitute for that far-off divine
event as puzzled man has to offer.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a minister of the Gospel who makes this
profound observation. But it sounds like our
present Secretary of War, a banker, and like
our present Commanding General, a professional
soldier. Here is sure proof that the human
race cannot learn the essential things, and so,
is doomed.</p>

<p>But I wish I might try my bees. This old
hoax of preventing war by preparing men to
fight has been so often tried! And we are at
it again. But no nation has tried my simple
and inexpensive substitute of bees and plough-shares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and pruning hooks. They have tried,
from time out of memory, to beat their swords
and spears into garden tools, but a sword makes
a mighty poor ploughshare. It has never been
successfully done. The manufacturing process
is wrong. It takes the temper out of good garden
steel first to heat it in the fires of war. We must
reverse the process: turn the virgin metal into
garden steel first, and give every man a hoe, and
a ploughshare, and a pruning hook; then he will
never have need for sword and spear.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of universal military training, I would
advocate a hive of bees for everybody, or a backyard
garden. A house should have both lawn
and garden, even though the gooseberries crowd
the house out to the roadside, where the human
house instinctively edges to see the neighbors
in their new pony-coats go by. Let my front
door stand open; while over the back stoop the
old-fashioned roses and the grape-vines draw
a screen.</p>

<p>But give me a house with a yard rather than a
hole in the wall, a city tenement, or a flat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
whole trend of society is toward the city, or
camp, military, rather than agricultural. The
modern city is a social camp. Life is becoming
a series of mass movements, military maneuvers,
at the command of social leaders. Industry has
long been militarized both in form and spirit,
and is rapidly perfecting its organization. Today,
1923, there are more than a hundred different
automobile manufacturing concerns in this
country. Only those capable of &#8220;quantity production&#8221;
will survive. Already the manufacturers
see the entire industry reduced to five different
concerns. This is strictly military, the making
of society into a vast, and vaster machine,
which, too great at last for control, will turn
upon and crush its makers.</p>

<p>We are all conscripted. The Draft Board of
industrialism allows no exemptions. The only
way I see is to desert, to take to the woods, as I
have done, to return individually to a simple,
elemental manner of life out of the soil. But who
can pay the social cost? Our social or camp
psychology is better understood and more easily
handled than the mind of the lone scout within
us. We are gregarious by nature; we hunt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
packs, we collect into crowds. Yet we are selves,
separate, single, each of us a cave-man as well
as cliff-dweller, a Remus as well as a Romulus.
The city-building brother killed his country
brother. And the murder still goes on.</p>

<p>Out of a commentary on the Bible I take the
following observation, partly for its charm, but
also because it holds a profound truth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>God&#8217;s people from the earliest time had never been
builders of cities. The earliest account of city-building
is that of the city of Enoch by Cain, and all the
subsequent mention of city-building is in connection
with the apostate families of the earth, such as
Nimrod and his descendants, the Canaanites and the
Egyptians. Sodom is one of the earliest mentioned
cities properly so called, and the story of it is not
encouraging for the people of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>But which is the city whose story is encouraging
to the people of God? Not Boston&#8217;s,
nor New York&#8217;s, nor London&#8217;s, nor Vienna&#8217;s.
Vienna is starving; the country is bankrupt
Austria&#8217;s governmental machine is a total wreck;
but the peasant goes his way, suffering little
inconvenience, though the crown is not to-day
worth the paper it is printed on. The peasant
lives on the land, not on the bank; he gets his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
simple life directly out of the soil instead of a
pay envelope; he has no New York, New Haven
and Hartford stock, worth one hundred and
eighty-six dollars yesterday, and ten dollars to-day,
to-morrow, and until he starves. He has a
piece of land and, impossible as it sounds on
paper, lives on it, and out of it, and in it, an
almost independent life, as the wage-slave and
the coupon-victim cannot live.</p>

<p>We shall face a famine, so long as our door-yards
are all lawn in front and all garbage-can
behind. We have farmers enough&mdash;one to
every eight of our population, I believe&mdash;who
might produce sufficient raw potatoes; but
Aroostook County is barely contiguous to the
United States, and such a barrage of frost was
laid down across its borders this last winter that,
if one brought potatoes out of Aroostook between
December and March, he had to bear them in
his bosom.</p>

<p>Aroostook County is the greatest potato-patch
in the world; the American imagination loves to
hover over the tubered tracts of Aroostook, the
<i>richest</i> county in the world; loves to feel that the
world could be fed from Aroostook, were it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for the triple alliance of the cold and the contiguity
and a railroad that runs, if not like a broken
tooth, then like a foot out of joint, into these
remote dreamlands of Maine.</p>

<p>Woe to them that go down to the railroads for
help; and stay on engines and trust in empties,
because they are many; and in officials, because
they are very strong. Now the officials are men
and not God, and their engines steel and not
spirit. Why should a rational, spiritual human
society trust its well-being to such paltry powers,
when all the forces of nature are at its command?</p>

<p>I will put more trust in an acre of land than
in a Continental Congress. I had rather have
a hoe at my right hand than an army of bank
presidents. Give me the rising and the setting
sun, the four seasons, and the peasant&#8217;s portion;
and you may have the portion of the president.</p>

<p>I said we have farmers enough to raise all we
need. We have more than enough. We have
more than enough bankers; more than enough
automobile-makers; more than enough store-keepers;
more than enough coal-miners; more
than enough cooks and janitors. But we have
nowhere near enough landowners and peasants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Nothing in the world would so straighten out
society as to declare next year a Year of Jubilee,
and give every man, not a job, but his birthright,
a piece of land.</p>

<p>We are over-organized and almost de-individualized.
But the time must again come when
every man shall dig and every woman spin, and
every family build its own automobile, distill
its own petrol, and work out its taxes on the
road. We shall always hold to the social principle
of the division of labor&mdash;I plough for
you; and you shoe my horse for me. But we
have carried the principle, in our over-organization,
to the point where a man&#8217;s whole part in
the world&#8217;s work consists in putting on the left
hind wheel of endless automobiles.</p>

<p>An eight-hour day will not save that man.
And he is typical of all men to-day. Only by his
acceptance of the duty to dig can he be saved,
and society with him. The principle of the division
of labor has been misapplied: instead of
specialization and the narrowing of each man&#8217;s
portion, it should be applied broadly, multiplying
his labors. Work is creative; it is self-expression;
and I should let no man do for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
what I can do. He robs me of living who robs
me of doing.</p>

<p>The theory of present-day society&mdash;specialization,
organization, combination, quantity
production&mdash;is a fatal application of a perfectly
sound principle. Six automobile combinations
which in a year can destroy a hundred lesser
combinations, can in another year destroy all
but one of each other; and that remaining one,
having nothing now to destroy, must turn and
destroy itself.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> I am concerned with life and literature.
How does the organization of society affect
books, admitting that it affects life? What is
a book but a life?&mdash;and a more abundant life?
Everybody who has lived has a book to write.
But only those who have lived abundantly
should write their books. Starve a nation
spiritually, as ours is being starved; reduce its
life to a mechanical routine; rob its labor of all
creative quality, and how shall it write?</p>

<p>The duty to dig applies first to the spirit.
There is sound economy in it if one&#8217;s political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
economy is sound. I do not say money. Economy
and money are not equivalent terms. I
digged as a duty last year; and as a result I did
not buy a potato from the &#8220;combine&#8221; in Maine;
I nearly got on without a pound of beef from
Chicago; and could have made my honey serve
for Cuban sugar. The same amount of time
spent putting left hind wheels on automobiles
might have brought me more money, and so,
more beef and potatoes and sugar, and so, more
gout and rheumatism. The duty to dig comprehends
a great deal more than ordinary
economy.</p>

<p>I would not imply that I can handle the Beef
Trust and the potato pirates and the sugar
barons with my humble hoe; or snap my fingers
in the face of Standard Oil, and say, &#8220;Go to,
I&#8217;ll have none of your twenty-eight-cent gas!&#8221;
I do say that several million bee-keepers and
potato-patchers, and hen-coopers, keeping busy
in their back yards, as I keep busy in mine,
could mightily relieve the railroad congestion,
and save gasoline, and cut in on the demand for
Chicago beef and cold-storage eggs, and generally
lower the high cost of living.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>It is not because there are &#8220;millions in it&#8221;
that I would have the banker plant his back
yard to beans. Thoreau planted two acres and
a half to beans and potatoes (on a weak market,
however), with a &#8220;pecuniary profit of $8.71&frac12;.&#8221;
Here is no very great financial inducement to a
busy banker, or to a ward boss. Still, who better
than the ward boss or the banker could afford
a private beanfield?</p>

<p>I say it is not for the sake of this $8.71&frac12;
profit of Thoreau&#8217;s that we must dig; but rather
for that chapter on the bean field in Walden
Pond, which proves the real worth of digging.</p>

<p>There can hardly be a form of labor so elemental,
so all-demanding, so abundantly yielding
of the fruits of life, as digging. Yet there are
those who doubt the wisdom of digging because
things can be bought cheaper at the store; and
those who question their right to dig when they
can hire a man to dig for them; and there are
those who hate to dig, who contemn duty, who,
if they plant, will plant a piece of fallow land
with golf-balls only, and hoe it with brassies,
niblicks, cleeks, and spooners, saying with
Chaucer&#8217;s Monk:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;... how shall the world be servèd?</div>
<div class="verse">Let Austyn have his swynk to his reservèd.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Golf is an ancient game, no doubt, but not
so old as gardening, though golf&#8217;s primordial
club and vocabulary seem like things long left
over, bits of that Missing-Link Period between
our arboreal and cave-day past. Except for calling
the cows from the meadow, or fighting in
war, there is nothing we do that requires words
and weapons, tools, instruments, implements,
utensils, apparatus, machinery, or mechanisms
so lacking in character and comeliness as the
words and clubs of golf. The gurglings of infants
seem articulate, even to unparental ears, compared
with the jargon of golf; and as for billiard-cues,
baseball-bats, pikes, spades, shillalahs,
and teething-rings, they have the touch of poetry
on them; whereas the golf-club was conceived
and shaped in utter unimaginativeness.</p>

<p>Golf is not an ancient game: it has the mark
of the Machine upon it; the Preadamites could
not have figured the game out. Gardening, on
the other hand, if we trust Holy Writ, was an
institution founded before the Fall, incorporated
with the social order from the start&mdash;an inherent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
essential element in the constitution of
human things:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Great nature&#8217;s <i>primal</i> course,</div>
<div class="verse">Chief nourisher in life&#8217;s feast,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;which civilization doth murder as Macbeth
murdered sleep.</p>

<p>Golf belongs to civilization strictly, not to
the human race, being one of life&#8217;s post-Edenic
precautions, like psychopathic hospitals, jails,
and homes for the feeble-minded. A golf course
is a little-wanderers&#8217; home; and if we must have
golf courses, let their hazards be carefully constructed
on worthless land, and let the Civil
Service Board examine the caddies, whether
they be fit guards for the golfers, lest some
small boy be wasted who might have tended
real sheep on Norfolk Downs or have weeded in
a garden.</p>

<p>It is a duty to dig, to nail the Stars and Stripes
to a lima-bean pole, and plant the banner square
in the middle of the garden. Profits? pleasures?
Both sorts will grow, especially the pleasures,
which really are part of the profits, till they fairly
smother the weeds; not the least of these being
your sense of living and your right to live, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
comes out of actually hoeing your own row&mdash;a
literal row of beans or corn or tomatoes.</p>

<p>Somebody must feed the soldiers; but nobody
must needs feed me. It is not necessary that I
live, however necessary I find it to eat; eating,
like sleeping and breathing and keeping warm,
being strictly a private enterprise that nobody
but I need see as necessary or be responsible
for.</p>

<p>The soldier must carry a shovel nowadays,
but he will require a hoe, too, and a pruning
hook, and a ploughshare, before he will be self-supporting.
With such a kit war could support
war forever, which is the Rathenau plan of war,
with everything German left out, consequently
everything of war left out. The soldier cannot
feed himself. The crew of a battleship cannot
be expected to catch their own cod and flounders.
They must leave that to the trawlers, those
human boats, with human crews who fish for a
living. Men of the navy must die for a living.
The captain of a United States destroyer, writing
to his wife, says, &#8220;I think that the only
real anxiety is lest we may not get into the big
game at all. I do not think that any of us are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
bloodthirsty or desirous of glory or advancement,
but we have to justify our existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>So does every human being; yet an existence
that can be justified only by fighting and dying
is too unproductive, too far from self-supporting,
to warrant the sure calling and election of many
of us. No Grand-Banker ever wrote so to his
wife, though he might be returning with all his
salt unwet; no college professor ever wrote so&mdash;not
if he could get into his garden&mdash;in spite of
his pupils, his college president, the trustees,
and Mr. Carnegie&#8217;s Efficiency Board. Teaching
may not justify a professor&#8217;s existence, though
it ought to justify his salary; so, every time I
start for the University, I put a dozen or two of
eggs into my book-bag, that I may have a right
to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
gates into the city.</p>

<p>I am not independent of society. I do not
wish to be independent. I wish to be debtor to
all and have all debtors to me. But we buy too
much and sell too much of life, and raise too
little. We <i>pay</i> for all we get. Sometimes we
get all we pay for, but not often; and if we never
did, still life has so thoroughly adopted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
business standard, that we had rather keep on
paying than trying to grow our way.</p>

<p>Business is a way of living by proxy; money
is society&#8217;s proxy for every sort of implement
and tool. To produce something, however&mdash;some
actual wealth, a pennyweight of gold-dust,
a pound of honey, a dozen eggs, a book, a boy,
a bunch of beets; some real wealth out of the soil,
out of my loins, out of my brains, out of my
muscles and the sap of the maple, the rains and
sunshine and the soil, out of the rich veins of the
earth or the swarming waters of the sea&mdash;this
is to be; and to be myself, and not a proxy, is
to lose my life and save it, and to justify my
existence.</p>

<p>I have to buy a multitude of things&mdash;transportation,
coal, dentistry, news, flour, and
clothes. I have paid in money for them. I have
also paid in real wealth, having given, to balance
my charge on society, an equivalent in raw cabbage,
pure honey, fresh eggs, and the like, from
my own created store. I am doubtless in debt
to society, but I have tried to give wealth for
wealth, not the symbol of it merely; and last
year, as I balanced my books, I think the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was in debt to me by several bunches of beets.
I do not boast of the beets, though they take me
out of the debtor&#8217;s prison where most of us live.
I can face the world, however, with those beets;
I have gone over the top, have done my bit, with
beets.</p>

<p>The oldest duty on the human conscience is
the duty to dig. I am a college teacher, and that
is an honorable, if futile, profession. The Scriptures
say: &#8220;He gave some, apostles; and some,
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
and teachers&#8221;; but, before there were any
such multifarious and highly specialized needs,
it was said unto our first father: &#8220;Replenish the
earth and subdue it&#8221;&mdash;a universal human
need, a call to duty, from which no Draft Board
of civilization can rightly exempt us.</p>

<p>Wealth is not created, not even increased, in
trade. When was one pennyweight of gold on
&#8217;change by any magic metallurgy of trade made
two pennyweight? The magic of the second
pennyweight is the metallurgy of the pick and
shovel and cradle rocking the shining sands of
the Yukon. Real wealth is only circulated in
trade. It comes from primal sources&mdash;from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
gold-fields, the cotton-fields, the corn-fields, the
fir-clad sides of Katahdin, the wide gray waters
of the Grand Banks, the high valleys of the
sheeped Sierras, and from back yards, like mine,
that bring forth thirty- and sixty- and an hundred-fold.</p>

<p>And this is as profoundly true of life and literature
as it is of cotton and lumber and gold.</p>

<p>Give me a garden and the wages of hoeing my

hens, a coop of pigeons, a colony of bees&mdash;even
in the city I should keep bees, if I had to keep
them in the attic or on the roof. Not every one
can have a garden, but every one can either plant
a tree, or raise one pig, or keep a cow or goat, or
feed a few hens, or raise a flock of pigeons, or
do something that will bring him personally into
contact with real things, and make it possible
for him to help pay his way with real wealth,
and in part, at least, to justify his existence, and
his book.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE MAN AND THE BOOK</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> on my desk lies a new book entitled, &#8220;For
the Benefit of My Creditors,&#8221; the autobiography
of Hinckley Gilbert Mitchell, a scholar,
a teacher in a school of theology&mdash;and now
this book, a simple, sad book of human struggle
and defeat, of spiritual and scientific adventure
and triumph and romance.</p>

<p>The scholar is not the accepted stuff of literature.
What of human interest can come out
of a classroom? Yet I have seen this scholar&#8217;s
classroom when it was wilder than ten nights
in a barroom crowded into one. I have seen
some lively and human times in my own classroom;
and I know that there is as real a chance,
and as magical a chance, there as Dana found
on the high seas. There are frontiers for the
scholar, especially in theology, as dangerous in
their crossing as any to be met with by the
overland pioneer.</p>

<p>Dana escaped from the decorous and the conventional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
life of social Boston by way of the
deep sea; Mitchell escaped from the decorous
and conventional dogma of his church by way
of honest study; and his Church tried him for
heresy, and found him guilty, and would have
burned him at the stake had that been the decorous
and conventional manner of dealing with
heretics at the moment. As it was, they only
branded him, and cast him out as a thing unclean.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is not a life human enough, and
abundant enough, for a book. It is the simple
story of a poor boy picking stones and building
walls on his father&#8217;s farm in New York
State; then, as Director of the American School
of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, rebuilding
&#8220;The Wall of Nehemiah&#8221;; then, as scholar
and professor, re-creating &#8220;The World before
Abraham&#8221;; and finally, as the storm center of
one of the bitterest theological controversies of
recent years, dismissed, dishonored, betrayed for
less than thirty pieces of silver, a silent, brokenhearted
man. It is only another version of an
old and very common story. Prophets and
pioneers are all alike; and their stories are much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
alike, whether the pages turn westward, where
new empires take their way, or eastward, back
along the scholar&#8217;s crossed and tangled trails to
a world before Abraham.</p>

<p>As the manuscript of the book lay upon my
table, I wondered if any publisher would feel the
human pathos of the struggle, and the mighty
meaning of it all for truth. Who would publish
it? But here it is, printed and bound, a book&mdash;&#8220;For
the Benefit of My Creditors,&#8221; as if he
were debtor to all, his enemies included, and
owed them only love.</p>

<p>This is as modest and self-withholding a
story as a man ever told of himself. There are
all too few of such human stories. This one
would never have been told had the author not
hated intellectual cowardice as he hated moral
cowardice, with a perfect hatred. He sought
the truth&mdash;in the Bible, and in his own mind.
The geologist seeks some of the same truth in
the rocks; the astronomer in the stars. The
Old Testament was this scholar&#8217;s field. And,
laying aside tradition and the spirit of dogma,
he sought as a scientist seeks, patiently, fearlessly,
reverently, for what his long and thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
preparation made him eminently able to
find.</p>

<p>This is the highest type of courage and daring.
Who finds truth finds trial and adventure. In
his condemnation by the bishops of his Church,
he felt that truth had been assailed and the
scientific method. He did not write this book
to defend the truth, nor to defend himself; but
to examine himself, as he would examine a
difficult fragment of Hebrew manuscript, and
make himself easy for other men to read.</p>

<p>His trial was long past, and most of his life
had been lived, before a page of his book was
written. He came at it reluctantly: he might
seem personal&mdash;petty or selfish or egotistical;
or he might say something bitter and vindictive
and do harm to the Church. But neither himself
nor his Church must stand in the way of truth;
and in his trial, truth had been tried, and the
only way of knowing truth had been condemned.
So he sits down to write this story of his life
exactly as he sat down to write a commentary
on the Book of Genesis&mdash;to account for his
being as a man and a scholar, his preparation,
his methods of study, his attitude, and approach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>How much truth has he discovered? He
makes no claims. Darwin may or may not have
the truth about Evolution; but we have a certain
and a great truth in Darwin&mdash;in his mind and
method. It was <i>how</i> Darwin tried to solve the
problem of life and its forms, rather than the
solution, that has changed the thinking of the
world.</p>

<p>For three years I was a student of Hebrew
and Old Testament Exegesis under this scholar.
I have forgotten all he taught me, and more.
But the <i>way</i> he taught me has changed forever
my outlook upon life. His attitude was truth,
and it flooded not only the whole mind, but
one&#8217;s whole being, with light. Many a time I
have sat in his classroom during the discussion
of some highly difficult and dangerous question
of doctrine, and said to myself, amid the drawn
daggers of those who had come to trap him,
&#8220;Right or wrong his findings, he is himself truth,
its life and way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Life enough for a book? He could have written
a book on teaching. For he loved to teach! He
loved to teach young preachers. He could not
preach; but he was the teacher born. The classroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was his from the foundation of the world.
Here he was preaching truly&mdash;from a thousand
future pulpits at the very ends of the earth. He
saw his students scattered over the whole world
preaching to the intelligences of men as well as
to their hearts; revealing the wisdom as well as
the love of God; and expounding a diviner
Bible because it was a wholly human Bible. In
all of these pulpits he heard himself speaking
with tongues not his own, but the message was
his own, the simple sincere faith of his classroom.</p>

<p>The thought of it thrilled him. It lifted him
up. He dwelt in the presence of the opportunity
as in the very presence of the Most High. As
humble a man as ever lived, doubting his every
power and gift, and relying only on the truth
to make him free, he would come into the classroom
and take his chair on the six-inch platform,
which raised him by so much above his
students, as if that platform were the Mount of
Transfiguration. His face would shine; his voice,
his gestures, his attitude working with his careful
words, made his whole being radiant with zeal
for the truth and love for us, his students, so
mysteriously given to his care.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Then suddenly, after more than twenty years
of this, he was expelled&mdash;driven from this
sacred classroom and branded as unsound, unsafe,
unfit!</p>

<p>No, not suddenly. It was only the verdict of
his judges that came suddenly. No one nowadays
could prepare his mind for a judgment like
that. For five or six of the years, during which
the trouble-makers, under pretense of study, had
elected his courses at the Theological School, I
had either been a student under him or his close
and sympathetic friend. I knew, as he knew,
that his enemies would stop at nothing in their
bitter zeal; still, I remember vividly the utter
shock and astonishment of the bishops&#8217; decision.
And I remember&mdash;for I cannot forget&mdash;its
strange numbing effect upon him. It came over
him slowly, else I think he might have died. It
crept upon him like a dreadful palsy, leaving
him dazed and dumb. He was too simple a man
to realize it quickly, too entirely single in mind
and heart to realize it wholly. It slowly crushed
him to the earth. And never in all the after
years was he whole again. His heart was broken.
He rose up and taught, until the very hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his death, but never again in his old classroom
nor with his old spirit. Day after day he would
pass by the Theological School with its hundreds
of eager students; he would see them gathering
at the hour of his lecture; but another teacher
(one whom he had trained) would come in and
take his place, while he plodded down the street
and on, a shepherd without his sheep.</p>

<p>Meantime he was called to teach in another
graduate school. He welcomed this new work.
He found honor, and love, and fellowship
among his new colleagues. They gave him freedom.
They created a place for him that had
not been before. He could teach what he wished
and as he wished. It was enough for them to
have him among them, and many a time he told
me of how unworthy he felt of all this love and
honor in his declining years, and how it had
stayed and steadied him in his deep defeat. But
they did not need him here&mdash;so he felt. It was
more for the honor of scholarship than for the
good he would do them. But he felt that they
did need him at his own beloved school, whose
policies he had helped to shape, whose spirit he
had helped to create, whose name and fame he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
had so largely helped to establish, and whose
students, crowding in from the east and from
the great west, he longed to take into his heart
and his home, as for so many happy years he
had been in the habit of doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,&#8221; he would cry as
he passed by on the street, a stranger, and saw
the students going in and out, &#8220;O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, which killeth the prophets, ... how
often would I have gathered thy children together,
even as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not!&#8221;</p>

<p>This, however, was not the doing of the school.
Faculty and students, with the exception of
those few who came for the express purpose of
accusing him, were loyal. The president of the
University, his close friend, was loyal, and did
all that lay in his power to prevent the iniquity
of the trial and the decision. This only added
to the tragedy. To have been tried by his peers
and co-laborers, by those who knew him and
the field of his labors, would have been perfectly
fair, but to be accused by three or four narrow-minded
students (one of whom recanted later
and all of whom deserve oblivion), who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
come with malice aforethought, whose very
presence in the school was a lie, to be accused by
such as these, I say, and then tried by a board
of judges, to whom he was largely a stranger,
not one of whom probably was his equal as a
scholar in the field involved&mdash;this made the
shame to the school, to himself, and to truth,
doubly deep and sore.</p>

<p>There remained one thing more for him to do;
and as soon as he could do it kindly, as a Christian,
and dispassionately, as a scholar, without
bias or prejudice or any personal ends except
the ends of gratitude and truth, he set about his
autobiography. And I wonder if, among autobiographies,
there is another that approaches
his for detachment, restraint, and self-negation;
for absolute adherence to the facts for the sake
of the truth involved, a truth not of self at all,
but wholly of scholarship? This is more of a
thesis than an autobiography&mdash;as if the author
were writing of another &#8220;Wall of Nehemiah,&#8221;
and no more involved in it, personally, than he
was present in &#8220;The World before Abraham&#8221;!</p>

<p>This is one of the most remarkable evidences
of severe and scientific scholarship that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ever seen; and it is equal evidence of the inherent
literary value of human life. No accusing word
is here, nothing bitter and unchristian. But
just the opposite: &#8220;For the Benefit of My Creditors&#8221;
is a work of love. His very character had
been assailed by his enemies, but this, while it
hurt, could not harm him. He stood upon his
conscious integrity, calm and silent. It was not
the attack upon himself that concerned him.
It was that Truth had been attacked. It was an
attempt to make the Bible a denominational
book; to confound truth with tradition and give
it a doctrinal color or a denominational slant.
The Church may compel its <i>theologians</i> to do
that if it has to, but its scholars, those who discover
truth, it should leave free. God and truth
are not denominational, nor Protestant nor
Catholic nor Hebrew. God is truth, and single
or separate, God and Truth belong to the fearless,
the frank, and the pure&mdash;in science not
more than in religion. For &#8220;are ye not as the
children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
of Israel?... Have not I brought up Israel out
of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from
Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>I recall the day we came upon that wonderful
passage in Amos in our study of this prophet;
and how for the first time in my life the universality
of truth dawned upon me out of that
passage. I had had a tribal, denominational
God, up to that time. I had been seeing different
kinds of truth&mdash;like the different tribes of old
in Palestine&mdash;warring truths, each with its own
territory, its own grip upon me, when suddenly,
as the &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; opened up this mighty saying
of Amos, I saw one God of us all, one truth for
us all, and all of us searching, under God&#8217;s leading,
for the truth. Henceforth the Philistines
and the Syrians and the children of Israel were
to be as the Ethiopians to me, as they are to
God&mdash;all of us led by him, and all of us free.
No teacher ever taught me a diviner lesson than
that.</p>

<p>It was not a body of truth that this great
teacher was called to expound. It was the spirit
of truth&mdash;the desire for truth, the search for
truth, the nature of truth, <i>that it is God</i>&mdash;this
was his high calling. And in condemning him,
his Church was confounding tradition and truth,
blocking the road to truth, and threatening, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
this example of him, to punish the daring who
discover and bring us forward into new realms of
truth. In his trial and condemnation the Church
was saying: &#8220;Study, but study to perpetuate the
past; to preserve the old; to defend doctrine, and
establish tradition. We have the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. No
new light can possibly break forth from God&#8217;s
word, or from any word. Revelation is closed.
And if you think you have new light, hide it, and
if you discover new truth, do not publish it, do
not teach it, for among the three hundred men
in your school there are three who have closed
their minds to light and truth, and have sworn
by all the past to keep them closed; and it would
jeopardize the Church if you should pry those
three minds open to the light and to the truth
of to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>These are not his words. There is a tang of
bitterness in them. They are mine. Yet it was
partly because he believed that the Church
meant to make him a warning to all scholars
and honest thinkers within its fold, that he set
about his autobiography, which he died writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rabbi,&#8221; we students called him affectionately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and strangely enough he seemed to look
the part. He was the thorough scholar. Careful,
methodical by nature, he was severely trained,
and to all of this he added a profound reverence
for the Book which was his life&#8217;s study, and felt
a deep sense of his responsibility as its teacher.
Had his life&#8217;s task been a haystack with one
single needle of divine truth lost within it, he
would have tirelessly taken it down, straw by
straw, for the needle of truth, just as Madame
Curie, aware of some mysterious power in the
crude common bulk of slag, patiently eliminated
pound after pound, ton after ton of the gross
elements until she held in her hand the pulsing
particle of radium, hardly larger than the head
of a pin, whose light illumines and almost blinds
the groping world. Had Professor Mitchell not
been a student of the Bible, he might have
been a student of chemistry, for his methods
and his zeal were exactly those of the discoverer
in any field, and it might have been his honor
and glory, as it chanced to be Madame Curie&#8217;s,
to give radium to the world.</p>

<p>Instead of glory, his was condemnation and
defeat. Yet his very mind and method, applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
anywhere else, would have won him distinction
and honor. There is no other mind or method,
except the closed mind and the method of appeal
to authority, as against the trial by experiment
and fact. Truth is truth whether in Theology
or in Chemistry, and only the open mind, the
free, the bold, the experimenting mind finds it.
Traditions have to be defended. Truth is its
own defense. The mind of the great scholar is
never on the defensive. Let &#8220;the Forts of Folly
fall,&#8221; he is far over the frontier where there is no
need for forts. So here in his life he writes not
to defend himself, but to express himself, his
gratitude; and to explain himself, his position,
his purpose, his principles as to the way of truth.</p>

<p>Here is a man who was as simple as he was
sincere. But simplicity in a great spirit is the
sign, the very expression of sincerity. He was
interested in all human things. He could make
wonderful coffee. He could build a stone wall
with the best of masons, and how he used to
tramp the woods with me for mushrooms!</p>

<p>I was a stranger in Boston and had been in
his classes for a week, perhaps, when I met him
downtown. It was a very real pleasure to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
stopped and called by name and quizzed by the
great Rabbi. What was I looking for in Boston?
A hammer? &#8220;Come along,&#8221; he said, turning
short about, &#8220;there&#8217;s a good hardware store
down this street. I&#8217;ll go with you and see that
you get a Maydole&mdash;a Maydole now&mdash;they&#8217;re
the only wear in hammers.&#8221; I got the Maydole;
that was twenty-six years ago; I have it yet.
His was a little act. But I have drawn many a
nail with that hammer. Yea, I have built him
a mansion with it.</p>

<p>I speak of that little thing because it was a
characteristic act. The details of life tremendously
interested him. He was entirely human
and as interested in the human side of his students
as he was in their intellectual and spiritual
sides. From my study window here in Hingham
as I write, eight stone faces stare at me out of
the retaining wall in the driveway,&mdash;big granite
chunks of boulder they were in my meadow years
ago. It was the Rabbi who rigged the tackle
and helped me put those stones here in the wall.
He could fix a toggle, he could &#8220;cut&#8221; and
&#8220;pize&#8221; and &#8220;wop&#8221; a stone with lever and
chain so as to &#8220;move mountains.&#8221; &#8220;There!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
There!&#8221; he would say, &#8220;let the mare do the
work; let the mare do the work,&#8221; when I would
rush up at a quarter-ton chunk of solid granite
and, bare-handed, try to hustle it on to the
stone-boat.</p>

<p>He had built stone walls before&mdash;back on the
hill farm in New York State, where he was born
and had his boyhood. Later he &#8220;restored&#8221; the
Wall of Nehemiah about Jerusalem, but not
with any more zest than he helped me build
with actual stones the retaining wall for my
driveway up Mullein Hill in Hingham. Such
is the man. Would he be substance for a
book?</p>

<p>Theological students are as naturally full of
trouble as rag-weeds are of pollen. They know
enough to doubt; they are old enough to be married;
they are poor; and they preach; and they
would like to be pious; but the world and the
flesh and the devil are against them. They are
only as good as the average of mankind, but they
have more than an average share of tribulations.
They need Hebrew&mdash;all of them&mdash;which is
one more terrible trouble! But they sorely need
human sympathy and wise counsel, and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
they got Hebrew or failed to get it, never a man
came into the Rabbi&#8217;s classroom who did not
also enter at the same moment into his open heart
and open home. Classroom and heart and home
belonged to every man who would enter. His
capacity for patience in the classroom was only
equaled by the boundless sympathy and the
simple hospitality of his near-by home.</p>

<p>Is it a wonder that the great body of his students
were confounded and dismayed that he
could be tried on some technical point or other
and be ejected from his chair as unfit to teach
those who were to preach the Gospel?</p>

<p>After the trial the enforced leisure was immediately
turned to new studies and larger literary
plans. Fresh fields were opened, too, for lecturing&mdash;in
the University of Chicago, in Harvard
University; and then soon came the invitation
to join the staff of Tufts Theological School as a
member of the faculty. Life has its compensations
and rewards; and if there was no cure for
the mortal wound he had received at the hands
of his brethren in his own Church, this invitation
to Tufts, and the perfect fellowship there to the
day he died, was a compensation and a satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that gave to his life a sweet reasonableness,
completeness, and reward.</p>

<p>There was no variableness nor shadow caused
by turning in his unhurried life. The loss of his
chair did not mean the end of his creative
scholarship. He worked to the last, and was
preparing for the day&#8217;s work when death came.
He knew our hearts, but we ourselves hardly
knew them till he had gone. Then the swift
word reached us, and we were told that we
should see him no more, that he was to be buried
afar with no service of any kind for him here&mdash;here
where he had labored so many years! It
could not be. On every hand his old pupils appeared&mdash;Methodist,
Universalist, Unitarian&mdash;in
one mind, all differences forgotten in their single
love for the honest scholar, the direct, the earnest,
the sincere teacher, the simple man, whose
life had been devoted to learning and to doing
good,&mdash;on every hand they app
eared and gave
him &#8220;The Grammarian&#8217;s Funeral.&#8221;</p>

<div class="verse"><i>When winter winds blow cold and chill</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And through the hawthorn howls the gale</i></div>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter winds were truly cold and chill on
this twenty-first of January here in Massachusetts.
And I chance to know they were chill down
along the Delaware this particular January day.
I remember many a January day like this on the
wide marshes of the Delaware and in the big
woods along the Maurice River where I was a
boy. But I was not thinking of those days at
all here in my New England home, for I was
busy at my desk.</p>

<p>Some one was at my study door. More than
one, for I heard low talking. Then the door
softly opened, and four bebundled boys stood
before me&mdash;with an axe, a long-handled shovel,
a covered basket, and a very big secret, which
stuck out all over their faces.</p>

<p>They were not big boys outside. But they
were almost bursting inside with their big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
secret. They were big with boots and coats and
caps and mittens; and they looked almost like
monsters in my study door with their axe and
shovel and big basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, father,&#8221; they whispered (as if
<i>She</i> hadn&#8217;t heard them tramping through the
hall and upstairs with their kit!), &#8220;come on!
It&#8217;s mother&#8217;s birthday to-morrow, and we&#8217;re
going after the flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Are you going to
chop the flowers down with an axe, and dig them
up with a shovel?&#8221; And I tried to think what a
chopped-down and dug-up birthday bouquet
would look like. But it was too much for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to give her a nice bunch of
frost flowers,&#8221; I said, feeling about in my puzzled
mind for just what was afoot. &#8220;If you are going
to give her frost flowers, you had better get the
ice-saw, too, for we shall need a big block of ice
to stick their stems in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a word of comment! No sign on the four
faces that they had even heard my gentle banter.
They knew what they were going to do; and all
they wanted of me was to come along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up,&#8221; they answered, dropping my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hip-boots on the floor. &#8220;Here are your scuffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hurried up! Scuffs and boots and cap and
reefer on in a jiffy, and the five of us were soon
in single file upon the meadow, the dry snow
squealing under our feet, while the little imp-winds,
capering fitfully about us, blew the snowdust
into our faces, or catching up the thin
drifts, sent them whirling and waltzing, like
ghostly dancers, over the meadow&#8217;s level glittering
floor.</p>

<p>I was beginning to warm up a little; but I was
still guessing about the flowers, and not yet in
the spirit of the game.</p>

<p>We were having a hard winter, and the novelty
of zero weather was beginning to wear off&mdash;at
least to me. The fact was I had intended to get
the birthday flowers down at the greenhouse
in the village. January is an awkward time to
have a birthday, anyhow. June is a much more
reasonable month for birthdays, if you gather
wild flowers for the celebration. The fields are
full of flowers in June! But here in January you
must go with an axe and a shovel, mittens,
rubber-boots, and reefers! And I confess I
couldn&#8217;t make head or tail of this festive trip.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>It is a lucky man who has boys, or who knows
and &#8220;trains,&#8221; as our New Englanders say, with
boys. They won&#8217;t let him freeze up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, father,&#8221; they say, &#8220;get into your
scuffs and boots, and hit the old trail for the
woods!&#8221; And father drops his pen; bundles up;
&#8220;clomps&#8221; out in his boots, grumbling at the
weather and the boys and the birthdays and
the stiffness in his knees and in his soul&mdash;for
a whole hundred yards or more into the
meadow! Then he begins to warm up. Then he
takes the axe from one of the boys and looks
at its edge, and &#8220;hefts&#8221; it; and looks about for
a big birthday flower, about the size of a hundred-year-old
oak, to chop down. Something queer
is happening to father. He is forgetting his
knees; he is capering about on the snow; he is
getting ahead of the boys; he hardly realizes it,
but he is beginning to feel like a birthday inside
of him; and he will soon be in danger of getting
this January day mixed up with the days of
June!</p>

<p>But not right off. I was warming up, I do
confess, yet it was a numb, stiff world about
us, and bleak and stark. It was a world that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
looked all black and white, for there was not a
patch of blue overhead. The white underfoot
ran off to meet the black of the woods, and the
woods in turn stood dark against a sky so heavy
with snow as to shut us apparently into some
vast snow cave. A crow flapping over drew a
black pencil-line across the picture&mdash;the one
sign of life that we could see besides ourselves.
Only small boys are likely to leave their firesides
on such a day; only small boys and those men
who can&#8217;t grow up. Yet never before, perhaps,
had boys or men ever gone afield on such a tramp
with an axe, a shovel, and a basket.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the boys dashed off calling,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see if the muskrats have gone to bed
yet!&#8221; And trailing after him away we went,
straight across the meadow. I knew what he
was after; I could see the little mound, hardly
more than an anthill in size, standing up in the
meadow where the alder bushes and elderberry
marked the bend in the brook. If my farmer
neighbor had forgotten a small haycock, when
he cut his rowen, it would have looked about as
this muskrat lodge here buried under the snow.
I was glad the boys had seen it. For only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
practiced eye could have discovered it; and only
a lover of bleak gray days would have known
what might be alive deep down under its thatch
of cat-tails and calamus here in the silent winter.</p>

<p>But is there any day in the whole year out of
doors that real live boys and real live girls do not
love? or any wild thing that they do not love&mdash;flower
or bird or beast or star or storm?</p>

<p>We crept up softly, and surrounded the lodge;
then with the axe we struck the frozen, flinty
roof several ringing blows. Instantly <i>one</i>&mdash;<i>two</i>&mdash;<i>three</i>
muffled splashy &#8220;plunks&#8221; were heard,
as three little muskrats, frightened out of their
naps and half out of their wits, plunged into the
open water of their doorways from off their
damp but cozy couch.</p>

<p>It was a mean thing to do, but not very mean
as wild animal life goes. And it did warm me up
so, in spite of the chilly plunge the little sleepers
took! Chilly to them? Not at all, and that is
why it warmed me. To hear the splash of water
down under the two feet of ice and snow that
sealed the meadow like a sheet of steel! To hear
the sound of stirring life, and to picture that
snug, steaming bed on the top of a tough old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tussock, with its open water-doors leading into
freedom and plenty below! &#8220;Why, it won&#8217;t be
long before the arbutus is in bloom,&#8221; I began
to think. I looked at the axe and shovel, and
said to myself, &#8220;Well, the boys may know what
they are doing, after all, though three muskrats
don&#8217;t make a spring or a bouquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they did make me warmer inside and outside,
too. Warm up your heart and you soon feel
warmer in your fingers and toes.</p>

<p>We turned back from the muskrats&#8217; lodge and
headed again for the woods, where the flowers
must be. Hardly had we reached the cart-path
before another of the boys was off&mdash;this time
to the left, going rapidly toward a low piece of
maple swamp perhaps a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going over to see if Hairy Woodpecker
is in his hole,&#8221; said the boys in answer to my
question. &#8220;Hairy has a winter hole over there
in a big dead maple. Want to see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course I wanted to see him. The only live
thing outside of ourselves that we had seen (we
had only <i>heard</i> the muskrats) had been a crow.
Live birds on such days as these one would go
far to see. So we all cut across toward the swamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
where the hairy woodpecker reigned solitary in
his bleak domain.</p>

<p>The &#8220;hole&#8221; was almost twenty-five feet up
in a dead maple stub that had blown off and
lodged against a live tree. The meadow had
been bleak and wind-swept, but the swamp was
naked and dead, filled with ice, and touched
with a most forbidding emptiness and stillness.
I was getting cold again, when the boy ahead
tapped lightly on the old stub. At the hole upstairs
appeared a head&mdash;a fierce black-and-white
head, a sharp, long bill, a flashing eye&mdash;as
Hairy came forth to fight for his castle. He
was too wise a fighter to tackle all of us, however;
so, slipping out, he spread his wings, and galloped
off with a loud wild call that set all the swamp
to ringing.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling, defiant challenge that set
my blood to leaping again. Black and white,
he was a part of the picture; but there was a
scarlet band in the nape of his neck that, like his
call, had fire in it and the warmth of life.</p>

<p>As his shout went booming through the hollow
walls of the swamp, it woke a blue jay, which
squalled back from a clump of pines, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
wavering out into the open on curious wings&mdash;flashing
ice-blue and snow-white wings&mdash;he
dived into the covert of pines again; and faint,
as if beyond the swamp, the cheep of chickadees!</p>

<p>If anything was needed up to this moment
to change my winter into spring, it was this call
of the chickadees. The dullest day in winter
smiles; the deepest, darkest woods speak cheerfully
to me, if a chickadee is there. And did you
ever know a winter day or a dank, gloomy forest
hall without its chickadee? Give me a flower
in my buttonhole and a chickadee in my heart
and I am proof against all gloom and cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is all this noise about?&#8221; the chickadees
came forward asking. It was a little troop
of them, a family of them, possibly, last year&#8217;s
children and one, or both, of the parents, hunting
the winter woods together for mutual protection
against the loneliness and long bitter cold.</p>

<p>How active and interested in life they were!
A hard winter? Yes, of course, but what is the
blue jay squawking over, anyhow? And the little
troop of them came to peep into the racket,
curious, but not excited, discussing the disturbance
of the solemn swamp in that sewing-bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
fashion of theirs, as if nipping off threads
and squinting through needle-eyes between their
running comments.</p>

<p>They too were gray and black, gray as the
swamp beeches, black as the spotted bark of the
birches. And how tiny! But&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Here was this atom in full breath</div>
<div class="verse">Hurling defiance at vast death;</div>
<div class="verse">This scrap of valor just for play</div>
<div class="verse">Fronts the north wind in waistcoat gray&#8221;;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and this is what Emerson says he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent3">&#8220;Good day, good sir!</div>
<div class="verse">Fine afternoon, old passenger!</div>
<div class="verse">Happy to meet you in these places</div>
<div class="verse">Where January brings few faces.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as I brought to mind the poet&#8217;s lines, I
forgot to shiver, and quite warmed again to the
idea of flowers, especially as one of the boys
just then brought up a spray of green holly with
a burning red berry on it.</p>

<p>I laid the spray of green holly on the hard
white crust of the January snow. Then I stood
a moment and spread my hands out over it to
warm them! It was like a little fire in the snow.
The boys laughed at me. They were warm
enough in their mittens. But I had need of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
than mittens to warm my fingers. I had need of
a fire,&mdash;a fire of green pointed holly leaves and
one glowing, flaming berry, a tiny red hot coal
of summer blazing here in the wide white ashes
of the winter.</p>

<p>We were tacking again now in order to get
back on our course, and had got into the edge of
the swamp among the pines when the boy with
the shovel began to study the ground and the
trees as if trying to find the location of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; he said, and began digging
through the snow at the foot of a big pine. I
knew what he was after. It was goldthread, and
here was the only spot in all the woods about
where we had ever found it, a spot no larger
than the top of a dining-room table.</p>

<p>Soon we had a fistful of the delicate plants
with their evergreen leaflets and long golden,
threadlike roots that, mixed with the red and
green of the partridge-berry in a finger-bowl,
make a cheerful winter bouquet. And here with
the goldthread, about the butt of the pine, was
the partridge-berry, too, the dainty vines strung
with the beads which seemed to burn holes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the snow that covered and banked their tiny
fires.</p>

<p>For this is all that the ice and snow had done.
The winter had come with enough wind to blow
out every flame in the maple-tops, and with
enough snow to smother every little fire in the
peat-bogs of the swamp; but peat fires are hard
to put out; and here and everywhere the winter
had only banked the fires of summer. Dig down
through the snow ashes anywhere, and the
smouldering coals of life burst into blaze.</p>

<p>When that red-beaded partridge-vine was
hastily placed with the goldthread in the
covered basket, and the spray of holly put with
them, a ray of light began to dawn on my snow-clouded
mind. Did I begin to see the bouquet
these boys were after? I said nothing. They
said nothing. They were watching me, though,
I knew, to see how long I should stumble blindly
on through these glorious January woods, which
were so full of joy for them.</p>

<p>I say I said nothing. I was thinking hard,
however. &#8220;Holly, goldthread, partridge-berry,&#8221;
I thought to myself. &#8220;I see so much of the birthday
bouquet. But what else can they find?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>The boy with the axe had again gone on
ahead. And we were off again after him, stopping
to get a great armful of black alder branches that
were literally aflame with red berries.</p>

<p>We were climbing a piny knoll when almost at
our feet, jumping us nearly out of our skins,
and warming the very roots of our hair, was a
burrrr! burrrr! burrrr! burrrr!&mdash;four big partridges&mdash;as
if four snow-mines had exploded
under us, hurling bunches of brown feathers on
graceful scaling wings over the dip of the hill!</p>

<p>This was getting livelier all the time. From
my study window how dead and deserted, and
windswept and bare the world had looked to
me! Nothing but a live crow winging wearily
against the leaden sky! But out here in the real
woods and meadows&mdash;partridges, chickadees,
hairy woodpecker, blue jay, and muskrats as
well as crows! And then I knew a certain old
apple tree where a pair of screech owls were
wintering. And, as for white-footed mice, I
could find them in any stump. Besides, here
were rabbit holes in the snow, and up in a tall
pine a gray squirrel&#8217;s nest and&mdash;</p>

<p>But I was losing sight of the boy with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
axe who was leading the procession. On we went
up over the knoll and down into a low bog where
in the summer we gathered high-bush blueberries,
the boy with the axe leading the way
and going straight across the ice toward the
middle of the bog.</p>

<p>My eye was keen for signs, and I soon saw
he was heading for a sweet-pepper bush with a
broken branch. My eye took in another bush
a little to the right also with a broken branch.
The boy with the axe walked up to the sweet-pepper
bush, and drew a line on the ice between
it and a bush off on the right, pacing off this line
till he found the middle; then he started at right
angles from it, and paced off a line to a clump
of cat-tails sticking up through the ice on the
flooded bog. Halfway back on this line he
stopped, threw off his coat, and began to chop
a hole about two feet square in the ice. Removing
the block of ice while I looked on, he rolled
up his sleeve, and reached down the length of
his arm through the ice water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the shovel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s down
here.&#8221; And with a few dexterous cuts he soon
brought to the surface a beautiful cluster of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
pitcher-plants, the strange, almost uncanny,
leaves filled with muddy water, but every pitcher
of them intact, shaped and veined and tinted
by a master potter&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Now at last I fully understood. Now I could
see what those boys had been seeing with their
inward eyes all the time. Now I had faith, too.
But how late! The bouquet of flowers was now
full.</p>

<p>We wrapped the wonderful pitcher-plant
carefully in newspapers, and put it into the basket,
starting back with our bouquet as cheerfully,
and as full of joy in the season, as we
could possible have been in June.</p>

<p>No, I did not say that we love January as
much as we love June. January here in New
England is a mixture of rheumatism, chilblains,
frozen water-pipes, mittens, overshoes, blocked
trains, and automobile-troubles by the hoodsful,
whereas any automobile will run in June. It
is so in Delaware and Texas and Oregon, too.</p>

<p>What I was saying is that we started home all
abloom with our pitcher-plants and goldthread
and partridge-berry and holly and glowing
black alder, and all aglow inside with our vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
tramp, and with the gray grave beauty of the
landscape, and with the stern joy of meeting
and beating the cold, and with the signs of life&mdash;of
the cozy muskrats in their lodge beneath the
ice-cap on the meadow; with the hairy woodpecker
in his deep warm hole in the heart of a
tree; with the red warm berries in our basket;
with the chirping, the capable, the conquering
chickadee accompanying us and singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;For well the soul, if stout within,</div>
<div class="verse">Can arm impregnably the skin;</div>
<div class="verse">And polar frost my form defied,</div>
<div class="verse">Made of the air that blows outside.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And actually as we came over the bleak meadow,
one of the boys said that he thought he heard
a song-sparrow singing! And I said I thought
the pussy-willows by the brook had opened a
little since we had passed them coming out!
And we all declared that the weather had
changed, and that there were signs of a break-up.
But the thermometer stood at fifteen above
zero when we got home&mdash;one degree colder
than when we started!</p>

<p>We had had a January thaw, however, and it
had come off inside of us, as the color on the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
glowing faces showed. The birthday came off
on the morrow, and I wonder if there ever was
a more interesting or a more loving gift of
flowers than those from the January woods?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>AFTER THE LOGGERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I lay</span> listening to the rain spattering against the
fly of the tent and dripping through the roof of
birch leaves upon the sputtering fire and soaking
down into the deep, spongy bottom of the forest&mdash;softly,
as soft as something breathing and
asleep. The guide and the boy beside me
were asleep, but I had been awakened by the
rain. The rain always wakens me. And in my
grave, I think, if I lie sleeping under a roof of
forest leaves, I shall wake and listen when it
rains. Before the stars sang together the primordial
waters made music to the rising land;
before the winds came murmuring through the
trees the waves were fingering the sweet-tuned
sands strung down the sounding shores; and
before the birds found their tongues, or the
crickets their little fiddles, or even the toad had
blown his quavering conch, it had rained! And
when it rained&mdash;and not until it rained&mdash;the
whole earth woke into song. Mother of music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
is the water, and, for me, the sweetest of her
daughters is the rain, and never sweeter, not
even on the shingles, nor down the rolled, fevered
blades of the standing corn, than in the deep
woods at night upon the low slant roof of your
tent.</p>

<p>But suddenly the singing stopped, and the
myriad rain-notes were turned to feet, tiny,
stirring feet, creeping down the tent, skipping
across the leaves, galloping over the forest floor,
and jumping in and out of the fire. Then a twig
snapped. Was that what had awakened me? I
rose up on my elbow slowly. The tent flap was
open; the woods were very dark, the dim light
from above the roof of leaves and rain showing
only shadows, and an ashen spot where the
camp-fire still spluttered, and beyond the ashen
spot a shadow&mdash;different from the other shadows;
a shape&mdash;a doe with big ears forward toward
the fire! A bit of birch bark flared in the
darkness, and the shape was gone. I could hear
her moving through the ferns; hear her jump
a fallen log and step out among the grating
pebbles on the shore. Then all was still, except
for the scampering rain, and the little red-backed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wood-mouse among the camp tins, and the
teeth of a porcupine chilled and chattering in
the darkness at the big wood-mouse among the
tins, and the rain running everywhere.</p>

<p>I dropped back upon my pillow and left off
listening. How good the duffle-bag felt beneath
my head! And the thick, springy bows of the
fir beneath the bag, how good they felt&mdash;springs
and mattress in one, laid underside up,
evenly, and a foot deep, all over the tent floor!
And how good they smelled! A bed of balsam-fir
boughs is more than a bed; it is an oblation
to Sleep, and not a vain oblation&mdash;after miles
of paddling in live water or a day of trailing
through the spruce and fir.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;There&#8217;s a long, long trail a-winding&#8221;</p>

<p>runs the song&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Into the land of my dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, speaking of sleep, there is no trail, except
a forest trail, that winds away to a land of such
deep dreamlessness as that of a woodman&#8217;s
sleep; and no sleep, from which a man will waken,
half so fragrant and refreshing as his. I do not
wish to be carried to the skies &#8220;on flowery beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of ease,&#8221; but I should like this balsam-fir bed,
for two or three weeks every summer, in the
woods of Maine. A reasonable and a wholesome
wish that, as I lay there wrapped in the fragrant
mantle of my couch, I coveted for city sleepers
everywhere.</p>

<p>The odors (we should spell them with a &#8220;u&#8221;)&mdash;the
odo<i>u</i>rs of the big woods are so clean and
pure and prophylactic! They clear the clogged
senses, and keep them in a kind of antiseptic
bath, washing a coated tongue as no wine can
wash it; and tingling along the most snarled of
nerves, straightening, tempering, tuning them
till the very heart is timed to the singing of the
firs. My bed of boughs was a full foot deep,
covering every inch of the bottom of the tent,
fresh cut that evening, and so bruised with the
treading as we laid them that their smell, in the
close, rainy air of the night, filled the tent like a
cloud. I lay and breathed&mdash;as if taking a cure,
this tent being the contagious ward of the great
hospital, the Out-of-Doors. All around me
poured the heavy, penetrating vapor distilled
from the gums, and resins, and oils, and sweet
healing essences of the woods, mingled here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the tent with the aromatic balsam of the fir.
I breathed it to the bottom of my lungs; but my
lungs were not deep enough; I must breathe it
with hands and feet to get it all; but they were
not enough. Then a breeze swept by the tent,
pausing to lay its mouth over my mouth, and,
catching away my little breath, breathed for me
its own big breath, until my very bones, like the
bones of the birds, were breathing, and every
vein ran redolent of the breath of the fir.</p>

<p>That breeze blew the sharp, pungent smell
of wood smoke past the tent. I caught it eagerly&mdash;the
sweet smoke of the cedar logs still smouldering
on the fire. There was no suggestion of
hospitals in this whiff, but camps, rather, and
kitchens, altars, caves, the smoke of whose
ancient fires is still strong in our nostrils and
cured into the very substance of our souls.</p>

<p>I wonder if our oldest racial memory may not
be that of fire, and if any other form of fire, a
coal off any other altar, can touch the imagination
as the coals of a glowing camp-fire. And I
wonder if any other odor takes us farther down
our ancestral past than the smell of wood smoke,
and if there is another smoke so sweet as cedar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
smoke, when the thin, faint wraith from the
smouldering logs curls past your tent on the slow
wind of the woods and drifts away.</p>

<p>It does not matter of what the fire is built.
I can still taste the spicy smoke of the sagebrush
in my last desert camp. And how hot that sagebrush
fire! And as sweet as the spicy sage is the
smell in my nostrils of the cypress and gum in
my camp-fires of the South. Swamp or desert
or forest, the fire is the lure&mdash;the light, the
warmth, the crackle of the flames, and the mystic
incense of the smoke rising as a sweet savor to
the deities of the woods and plains.</p>

<p>It is the camp-fire that lures me to the woods
when I might go down to the sea. I love the sea.
Perhaps I fear it more; and perhaps I have not
yet learned to pitch my tent and build my fire
upon the waves; certainly I have not yet got
used to the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le smell. For, of all foul odors
known to beast or man, the indescribable stench
of the fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;le is to me the worst. What wild
wind of the ocean can blow that smell away?
When bilges are sprayed with attar of roses, and
fo&#8217;c&#8217;s&#8217;les sheathed in sandalwood, and sailors
given shower-baths and open fires, I shall take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
vacation before the mast; but until then give
me the woods and my fir-bough bed, and my
fire of birch and cedar logs, and the rain upon
my tent.</p>

<p>When I woke at dawn it was still raining; and
off and on all day it rained, spoiling our plans
for the climb up Spencer Mountain and keeping
us close to camp and the drying fire. The forest
here at the foot of the mountain was a mixed
piece of old-growth timber, that had been logged
for spruce and pine some years before&mdash;as
every mile of the forest of Maine has been logged&mdash;yet
so low and spongy was the bottom that
the timber seems to have overgrown and long
since ceased to be fit for lumber, so that most
of it was left standing when the lumber-jacks
went through. We were camped by the side of
Spencer Pond in the thick of these giant trees&mdash;yellow
birch, canoe birch, maple and spruce,
hemlock and fir and pine&mdash;where the shade
was so dense and the forest floor so strewn with
fallen trees that only the club mosses, and the
sphagnum, and a few of the deep-woods flowers
could grow. The rain made little difference to
my passage here, so low were these lesser forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
forms under the perpetual umbrage of the
mighty trees, and I came back from as far in as
I dared to venture on so dull a day, my clothes
quite dry, but my spirit touched with a spell of
the forest, which I should have missed had the
sun been shining and the points of the compass
clear.</p>

<p>For in the big woods one is ever conscious of
direction, a sense that is so exaggerated in the
deepest bottoms, especially when only indirect,
diffused light fills the shadowy spaces, as to
border on fear. I am never free, in a strange
forest, from its haunting Presence; so close to
it that I seem to hear it; seem able to touch it;
and when, for a moment of some minor interest
or excitement, I have forgotten to remember
and, looking up, find the Presence gone from
me, I am seized with sudden fright. What other
panic comes so softly, yet with more terrible
swiftness? And once the maze seizes you, once
you begin to meet yourself, find yourself running
the circle of your back tracks, the whole mind
goes to pieces and madness is upon you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Set where you be and holler till I come get
ye, if ye&#8217;re lost,&#8221; the guide would say. &#8220;Climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a tree and holler; don&#8217;t run around like a side-hill
gouger, or you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not know what sort of animal is Johnny&#8217;s
side-hill gouger; though I saw, one day, far up
on the side of the mountain a big bare spot where
he had been digging&mdash;according to the guide.
It is enough for me that there is such a beast
in the woods, and that he gets those who turn
round and round in the forest on rainy days
and forget to look up.</p>

<p>The gouger was abroad in the woods to-day.
The clouds hung at the base of the mountains,
just above the tops of the trees; the rain came
straight down; the huge fallen trunks lay everywhere
criss-cross; and once beyond the path to
the spring the semi-gloom blurred every trail
and put at naught all certainty of direction.</p>

<p>But how this fear sharpened the senses and
quickened everything in the scene about me! I
was in the neighborhood of danger, and every
dull and dormant faculty became alert. Nothing
would come from among the dusky trees to
harm me; no bear, or lynx, or moose, for they
would run away; it was the dusk itself, and the
big trees that would not run away; and I watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
them furtively as they drew nearer and nearer
and closed in deeper about me. I knew enough
to &#8220;set down and holler&#8221; if I got turned hopelessly
around; but this very knowledge of weakness,
of inability to cope alone with these silent,
sinister forces, woke all my ancient fears and
called back that brood of more than fabled monsters
from their caves and fens and forest lairs.</p>

<p>This was the real woods, however, deep, dark,
and primeval, and no mere fantasy of fear. It
looked even older than its hoary years, for the
floor was strewn with its mouldering dead, not
one generation, but ages of them, form under
form, till only long, faint lines of greener moss
told where the eldest of them had fallen an æon
since and turned to earth. Time leaves on nothing
its failing marks so deeply furrowed as upon
men and trees, and here in the woods upon no
other trees so deeply as upon the birches. Lovely
beyond all trees in their shining, slender youth,
they grow immeasurably aged with the years,
especially the yellow birch, whose grim, grizzled
boles seemed more like weathered columns of
stone than living trees.</p>

<p>One old monster, with a hole in his base that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
bear might den in, towering till his shoulders
overtopped the tallest spruce, stood leaning his
gnarled hands upon the air, as a bent and aged
man leans with his knotty hands upon a cane. A
hundred years he might have been leaning so; a
hundred years more he might continue in his
slow decline, till, with a crash, he falls to lie for a
hundred years to come across a prostrate form
that fell uncounted years before.</p>

<p>I was standing on the tough, hollow rind of
such a birch, so long, long dead that its carcass
had gone to dust, leaving only this empty shell
that looked like a broken, half-buried piece of
aqueduct. It was neither tree nor pipe, however,
but the House of Porcupines, as I could
plainly hear by the grunting inside. A pile of
droppings at the door of the house told the story
of generations of porkies going in and out before
the present family came into their inheritance.
I knocked on the rubbery walls with my foot,
but not hard, for I might break through and hurt
Mother or Father Porky, or possibly the baby
that I saw along the pond that night. No careful,
right-minded person steps on or hurts a
porcupine in any manner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>I went on out of the sound of their teeth,
for chattering teeth are not consoling, and the
woods were gray enough. Gray and vast and
magnificently ruinous, yet eternally new they
were, the old walls slowly crumbling, and over
them, out of their heaped disorder, the fresh
walls rising to the high-arched roof that never
falls. To-day the deep, hollow halls were shut
to me by the arras of the gloom, and so smoky
rolled the rain beneath the roof that even the
black rafters of the birches were scarcely visible;
but all the closer about me, in the wildest
wealth and splendor, lay the furniture of the
forest floor.</p>

<p>Never were wools dyed and woven with a pile
so rich and deep as the cover of mosses and
lichens that carpeted this rude, cluttered floor.
Rolled and wrinkled and heaped up over the
stumps, it lay, nowhere stretched, nowhere
swept, a bronze and green and gold ground, figured
and flowered endlessly; and down the longest,
deepest wrinkle a darkling little stream!
It was a warp of sphagnum moss with woof
of lichens, liverworts, ferns, mushrooms, club
mosses, and shier flowers of the shadows, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was woven for the carpet&mdash;long, vivid runners
of lycopodium, the fingered sort, or club moss,
and its fan-leaved cousin, the ground pine, now
in fruit, its clusters of spikes like tiny candelabra
standing ready to be lighted all over the floor;
and everywhere, on every tree-trunk, stump,
and log, and stone the scale mosses, myriads of
them, in blotches of exquisite shapes and colors,
giving the gray-green tone to the walls as the
sphagnums gave the vivid bronze-green to the
floor. Down to about the level of my head, the
dominant note in the color scheme of the walls,
hung the gray reindeer moss, tufts and shreds
and pointed bunches of it like old men&#8217;s grizzled
beards. Some of the spruces and twisted cedars
were covered with it. Shorter in staple than the
usnea of the South, stiffer and lighter in color,
it is far less somber and funereal; but a forest
bearded with it looks older than time. This
moss is the favorite winter food of the moose
and caribou and deer, and so clean had the
moose and deer eaten it from the trees, up as
high as they could reach, that the effect on a clear
day was as if a thin gray fog had settled in the
forest at an even six-foot level from the ground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>Worked in among the lichens and mosses,
quite without design, were the deep-woods
flowers&mdash;patches of goldthread, beds of foam-flower
and delicate wood-sorrel and the brilliant
little bunchberry. Wherever the sunlight had
a chance to touch the cold, boggy bottom it
seemed to set the punk on fire and blaze up into
these scarlet berries, stumps and knolls and
slopes aflame with them, to burn on through the
gloom until they should be smothered by the
snow. Twin-flower and partridge-berry were
laced in little mats about the bases of the trees;
here and there the big red fruit of trillium and
the nodding blue berries of clintonia were mixed
in a spot of gay color with berries of the twisted
stalk, the wild lily-of-the-valley, and the fiery
seed-balls of the Indian turnip.</p>

<p>These touches of color were like the effect of
flowers about a stately, somber room, for this
was an ancient and a solemn house of mighty
folk. If the little people came to dwell in the
shadow of these noble great they must be content
with whatever crumbs of sunshine fell from
the heaven-spread table over them to the damp
and mouldering floor. There were corners so dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that only the coral orchid and the Indian pipe
pushed up through the mat of leaves; and other
spots, half open to the sky, where the cinnamon
fern and the lady fern waved their lovely plumes,
and the wood fern, the beech, the oak, and the
crested shield ferns grew together, forced thus
to share the scanty light dropped to them from
the overflowing feast above.</p>

<p>But I never saw mushrooms in such marvelous
shapes and colors and in such indescribable
abundance as here. The deep forest was like a
natural cavern for them, its cold, dank twilight
feeding their elfin lamps until the whole floor
was lighted with their ghostly glow. Clearest
and coldest burned the pale-green amanita, and
with it, surpassingly beautiful in color and design,
the egg-topped muscaria, its baleful taper
in a splotched and tinted shade of blended orange
yellows, fading softly toward the rim. Besides
these, and shorter on their stems, were white
and green and purple russulas, and great burning
red ones, the size of large poinsettia blooms;
and groups of brown boletus, scattered golden
chanterelles, puff-balls, exquisite coral clusters,
and, strangest of them all, like handfuls of frosted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
fog, the snowy medusa. These last I gathered
for my lunch, together with some puff-balls and
a few campestris, whose spores, I suppose, may
have been brought into the woods with the
horses when this tract was lumbered years ago.
But I had little appetite for mushrooms. It
was the sight of them, dimly luminous in the
rain, that held me, their squat lamps burning
with a spectral light which filled the dusky
spaces of the forest full of goblin gloom.</p>

<p>As I sat watching the uncanny lights there
was a rush of small feet down the birch at my
back, a short stop just above my head, and a
volley of windy talk that might have blown out
every elf light in the neighborhood. It was very
sudden and, breaking into the utter stillness, it
was almost startling. A moose could hardly
have made more noise. I said nothing back nor
took any notice of him. He could kick up the
biggest sort of a rumpus if he wished to, for the
woods needed it. I only wondered that he had
a tongue, dwelling forever here in this solitude.
But a red squirrel&#8217;s tongue is equal to any
solitude, and more than once I have caught him
talking against it, challenging the silence of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
outdoors, as I have seen small boys challenge
each other to a blatting-match.</p>

<p>By and by I turned, and so startled him that
he dropped a cluster of green berries from his
mouth almost upon my head. It was a large
bunch of arbor vitæ berries that he was going to
store away, for, though he sleeps much of the
winter, he is an inveterate hoarder, working
overtime, down the summer, as if the approaching
winter were to be seven lean years long.</p>

<p>I was glad he had not obtruded earlier, but
now he reminded me properly that it was long
past noon, and high time for me to get back to
camp. It was later than I thought, for the woods
had gradually grown lighter, the rain had almost
ceased, and by the time I reached camp
had stopped altogether. While we were at supper
the sun broke through on the edge of the
west and ran the rounded basin of the pond
over-full with gold. I stepped down to the shore
to watch the glorious closing of the day. The
clouds had lifted nearly to the tops of the mountains,
where their wings were still spread,
feathering the sky with gray for far around; a
few fallen plumes lying snowy white upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
dark slopes of the lesser hills; then pouring down
the hills into the pond, splashing over the gleaming
mountains and up against the sky, burst the
flood of golden light with indescribable glory.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; said the guide, touching me on
the arm, and I stepped into the bow of the canoe
as he pushed quietly off. An Indian never
moved with softer paddle, nor ever did a birch-bark
canoe glide off with the ease of this one
under the hand of John Eastman, as we moved
along in the close shadows of the shore.</p>

<p>The light was passing, but the flush of color
still lay on the lovely face of the water with a
touch of warmth and life that seemed little less
than joy; a serene, but not a solemn joy, for
there was too much girlish roundness and freshness
to the countenance of the water, too much
happiness in the little hills and woods that
watched her, and in the jealous old mountain
that frowned darkly down. Mine, too, were the
eyes of a lover, and in my heart was the lover&#8217;s
pain, for what had I to offer this eternal youth
and loveliness?</p>

<p>The prow of the canoe swerved with a telling
movement that sent my eyes quick to the shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to see a snow-shoe rabbit racing down a little
cove hard at me, with something&mdash;a stir of
alder leaves, a sound of long, leaping feet making
off into the swamp&mdash;that had been pursuing
him. It was probably a wildcat that had
leaped and missed the rabbit and seen us from
within his covert. What lightning eyes and
lightning legs, thus to leap and turn together!
The rabbit had run almost to the canoe, and
sat listening from behind a root at the edge of
the water, ears straight up and body so tense
with excitement that we nosed along close
enough to touch him with a paddle before he
had eyes and ears for us. Even then it was his
twitching, sensitive nose that warned him, for
his keen ears caught no sound; and, floating
down upon him thus, we must have looked to his
innocent eyes as much like a log or a two-headed
moose as like men.</p>

<p>Softly in and out with the narrow fret of
shadow that hemmed the margin of the pond
swam the gray canoe, a creature of the water,
a very part of our creature selves, our amphibious
body, the form we swam with before
the hills were born. Brother to the muskrat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the beaver, I stemmed along, as much at home
as they among the pickerel-weed and the cow-lilies,
and leaving across the silvery patches of
the open water as silent a wake as they.</p>

<p>Nothing could move across such silvery quiet
without a trail. So stirless was the water that
the wake of a feeding fish was visible a hundred
yards away. Within the tarnished smooches of
the lily-pads a muskrat might move about and
not be seen; but not a trout could swirl close to
the burnished surface of the open water without
a ripple that ran whispering into every little
inlet around the shore. The circle of the pond
was almost perfect, so that I roved, at a glance,
the whole curving shore-line, watching keenly
for whatever might come down to feed or drink.</p>

<p>We came up to a patch of pickerel-weed and
frightened a brood of half-grown sheldrakes that
went rushing off across the water, kicking up a
streak of suds and making a noise like the
launching of a fleet of tiny ships. Heading into
a little cove, we met a muskrat coming straight
across our bows. A dip of the paddle sent us
almost into her. A quicker dive she never made
nor a more startling one, for the smack as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
struck the water jumped me half out of the
canoe. Her head broke the surface a dozen
yards beyond us, and we followed her into the
mouth of a stream and on to a hummock into
which she swam as a boat swims under a bridge,
or more as a train runs into a tunnel, for an
arching hole opened into the mound, just above
the level of the stream, through which she had
glided out of sight. Hardly had she disappeared
before she popped up again from deep under
the mound, at the other side, and close to the
canoe, starting back once more down-stream.
She had dodged us. Her nose and eyes and
ears were just above the water and a portion
of her back; her bladelike tail was arched, its
middle point, only, above the surface, its sheering,
perpendicular edges doing duty as propeller,
keel, and rudder all at once.</p>

<p>As she made off the guide squeaked shrilly
with his lips. Instantly she turned and came
back, swimming round and round the canoe,
trying to interpret the sounds, puzzled to know
how they could come from the canoe, and fearing
that something might be wrong inside the
house. She dived to find out. By this time two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
young ones had floated into the mouth of the
tunnel, thinking their mother was calling them,
blinking there in the soft light so close that I
might have reached them with my hand. Satisfied
that the family was in order, the old rat
reappeared, and no amount of false squeaking
would turn her back.</p>

<p>A few bends up the stream and we heard the
sound of falling water at the beaver dam. Fresh
work had been done on the dam; but we waited
in vain for a sight of the workers. They would
not go on with their building. One of the colony
(there were not more than two families of them,
I think) swam across the stream, and came
swiftly down to within a few feet of us, when,
scenting us, perhaps, he warped short about
and vanished among the thick bushes that
trailed from the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>A black duck came over, just above our
heads, with wings whirring like small airplane
propellers, as she bore straight out toward the
middle of the pond. We were passing a high
place along the shore when a dark object, a
mere spot of black, seemed to move off at the
side of us against the white line of the pebbles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and I found that I was already being sent silently
toward it. My pulse quickened, for the thing
moved very slowly; and behind it a lesser blur
that also moved&mdash;very slowly; so deep was
the darkness of the overhanging trees, however,
that the nose of the canoe ploughed softly into
the sand beside the creatures, and I had not
made out the fat old porcupine, and, creeping a
foot or two behind her, as if he might catch up
by to-morrow, perhaps, the baby porky.</p>

<p>The old mother was feeding on bits of lily-pads
washed up along the shore, picking them
from among the stones with her paws as if she
intended to finish her supper by to-morrow,
perhaps, when her baby had covered the foot
or two of space between them and caught up
with her. She was so intent on this serious and
deliberate business that she never looked up as
I stopped beside her; she only grunted and
chattered her teeth; but I disturbed the baby,
apparently, for he speeded up, and pretty soon
came alongside his mother, who turned savagely
upon him and told him to mind his manners,
which he did by humping into a little heap,
sticking his head down between two stones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
raying the young quills out across his back in a
fan of spines. He didn&#8217;t budge for about five
minutes. Then he hurried again&mdash;right up
beside the old one&mdash;a thing so highly improper
in porkypinedom, and so deleterious to porkypine
health, that she turned and, with another
growl, humped her fat little porky again into a
quiet and becoming bunch of quills. This time
she read him a lecture on the &#8220;Whole Duty of
Children.&#8221; It was in the porcupine-pig language,
and her teeth clicked so that I am not sure I got
it verbatim, but I think she said, quite distinctly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;A child should always say what&#8217;s true,</div>
<div class="verse">And speak when he is spoken to,</div>
<div class="verse">And behave mannerly at table:</div>
<div class="verse"><i>At least as far as he is able</i>&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>for, seeing him so obediently and properly
humped, she repented her of her severity and,
reaching out with her left paw, picked up a
nice, whole lily-pad and, turning half around,
handed it to him as much as to say, &#8220;There,
now; but chew it up very thoroughly, as you did
the handle of the carving-knife in the camp last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>It was a sweet glimpse into the family life of
the woods; and as the canoe backed off and
turned again down-stream I was saying to myself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Every night my prayers I say,</div>
<div class="verse">And get my dinner every day,</div>
<div class="verse">And every day that I&#8217;ve been good</div>
<div class="verse">I get an orange after food&#8221;&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>or a nice, round lily-pad.</p>

<p>The precious light was fading, and we had yet
more than half the magic circle of the shore to
round. As we passed out into the pond again
a flock of roosting blackbirds whirred noisily
from the &#8220;pucker-brush,&#8221; or sweet-gale bushes,
frightened by the squeal of the bushes against
the sides of the canoe; and hardly had their
whirring ceased when, ahead of me, his head up,
his splendid antlers tipped with fire, stood a
magnificent buck. He had heard the birds, or
had scented us, and, whirling in his tracks,
curiosity, defiance, and alarm in every line of his
tense, tawny body, stood for one eternal instant
in my eye, when, shaking off his amazement, he
turned and, bounding over the sweet-gale and
alders, went crashing into the swamp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>I had neither camera nor gun; but, better
than both, I had eyes&mdash;not such good eyes
as John Eastman&#8217;s, for he could see in the dark&mdash;but
mine with my spectacles were better than
a camera; for mine are a moving-picture theater&mdash;screen,
film, machine, and camera, all behind
my spectacles, and this glorious creature for the
picture, with the dark hills beyond, the meadowy
margin of the pond in the foreground, and
over the buck, and the pond, and the dark green
hills, and over me a twilight that never was nor
ever can be thrown upon a screen!</p>

<p>I had come into the wilds of Maine without
so much as a fish-line&mdash;though I have fished
months of my life away, and am not unwilling
to fish away a considerable portion of whatever
time may still be left me. But am I not able,
in these later days, to spend my time &#8220;in the
solitude of this vast wilderness with other employments
than, these,&mdash;employments perfectly
sweet and innocent and ennobling? For one
that comes with a pencil to sketch or sing, a
thousand come with an axe or rifle. What a
coarse and imperfect use Indians and hunters
make of Nature!... Strange that so few ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
come to the woods to see how the pine lives and
grows and spires, lifting its evergreen arms to
the light,&mdash;to see its perfect success; but most
are content to behold it in the shape of many
broad boards brought to market, and deem <i>that</i>
its true success!... Every creature is better
alive than dead, men and moose and pine trees,
and he who understands it aright will rather
preserve its life than destroy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thoreau did not teach me that truth, for
every lover of life discovers it himself; but how
long before me it was that he found it out, and
how many other things besides it he found out
here in the big woods! Three-quarters of a century
ago he camped on Katahdin, and on Chesuncook,
and down the Allegash; but now he
camps wherever a tent is pitched or a fire is
lighted in the woods of Maine. His name is on
the tongue of every forest tree, and on every
water; and over every carry at twilight may be
seen his gray canoe and Indian guide.</p>

<p>And I wonder, a century hence, who will camp
here where I am camping, and here discover
again the woods of Maine? For the native shall
return. And as &#8220;every creature is better alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
than dead, man and moose and pine tree&#8221;; and
as &#8220;he who understands it aright will rather
preserve <i>his</i> life than destroy it&#8221; so shall he seek
his healing here.</p>

<p>The light had gone out of the sky. It was
after nine o&#8217;clock. A deep purple had flowed in
and filled the basin of the pond, thickening about
its margins till nothing but the long chalk-marks
of the birches showed double along the shore.
The high, inverted cone of Spencer stood just
in front of the canoe as we headed out across the
pond toward the camp, its shadow and its substance
only faint suggestions now, for all things
had turned to shadow, the solid substance of the
day having been dissolved in this purple flood
and poured into the beaker of the night. A
moose &#8220;barked&#8221; off on a marshy point near
the dam behind us; a loon went laughing over,
shaking the hollow sides of Spencer and all the
echoing walls of the woods with his weird and
mirthless cry. Against the black base of the
mountain a faint bluish cloud appeared&mdash;the
smoke of our camp-fire that, slowly sinking
through the heavy air, spread out to meet us
over the hushed and sleeping pond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>WOODCHUCK LODGE AND LITERATURE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> I proof of my contention here? Throughout
this book, on many sides of the question, I
have argued that the earth is as young as it
ever was; that Nature, though it can all but be
destroyed in spots, as in New York City, cannot
be tamed; that we are still the stuff of
dreams, if we could find rest for our souls and
the chance to dream. We are not lacking imagination
and the power for high endeavor. We
master material things; we can also handle the
raw materials of the spirit and give them enduring
form. But how can we come by the raw
materials of the spirit? And where shall we
find new patterns on which to mould our new
and enduring forms? Matter and pattern are
still to be found in nature&mdash;substance, essence,
presence,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</div>
<div class="verse">And the round ocean and the living air,</div>
<div class="verse">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>I have had much to do with young people,
especially with those of creative minds, divinely
capable minds, could they be freed from the
doubt of their times, and the fear of their own
powers. Here let me give them a glimpse of an
<i>old</i> man of their own times, these evil times when
all of the raw material of books has been used
up; an old man with a boy&#8217;s eyes and a child&#8217;s
heart and a pen and a bluebird or two, and
a woodchuck&mdash;and, of course, a magical
chance.</p>

<p>It was an October day. And how it rained
that day! An October day in the Catskills, and
I was making my way, with my friend DeLoach,
out of the little village of Roxbury by the road
that winds up the hills to Woodchuck Lodge.
Hardscrabble Creek knew it was raining, and
met me noisily at a turn of the road, just before
I came to the square stone schoolhouse (now a
dwelling) where little Johnny Burroughs had
gone for his book learning some seventy-five
years before. Leaving the creek, I found myself
on a roller-coaster road athwart the hills, making
up with spurt and dip to a low, weathered
farmhouse, thin and gray and old, that seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to be resting by the roadside thus far over the
mountain on its way to the valley.</p>

<p>I knew it from the distance and through the
rain, only it seemed even older, smaller, poorer
than I had expected to find it. But how close
it sat to the roadside, and how eagerly it gazed
down into the valley where the store and the
station and the meeting-house were&mdash;to see
who might be stirring, I thought, down there
in the valley! Or perhaps it sat here for
the landscape. I was approaching Woodchuck
Lodge, and it seemed very old and lonely in the
rain that slanted along the wide gray slopes,
and too frail to stand long against the pull of
the valley and the push of the heights crowding
hard upon it from behind.</p>

<p>A tiny kitchen garden at its corner, and across
the road a stone wall, an orchard of untrimmed
apple trees bent with fruit, and a small barn
on the edge of a sharply falling field&mdash;this was
the picture in the rain, the immediate foreground
of the picture, which stood out on a field
of hay-lands and pastures rolling out of the rainy
sky and down, far down where their stone walls
ran into the mists at the bottom of the valley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>These were the ancestral fields. Burroughs
was born a little farther along this road, the
house no longer standing. Here at the Lodge he
was now living, and in the old barn across the
road he had a study. These were his fields by
right of pen, not plough; these were his buildings,
too, and they showed it. They sheltered
him and gave him this outlook, but they utterly
lacked the pride of the gilded weathervane,
the stolid, four-square complacency, that
well-fed, well-stocked security of the prosperous
American farm. An old pair of tramps were
house and barn, lovers of the hills, resting here
above the valley. It was in that old barn, on an
overturned chicken-coop, with a door or some
other thing as humble for table, that Burroughs
had written most of the chapters in &#8220;The Summit
of the Years,&#8221; in &#8220;Time and Change,&#8221;
&#8220;The Breath of Life,&#8221; and &#8220;Under the Apple-Trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>So a literary farm should look, I suppose,&mdash;a
farm that produces books as abundantly as a
prairie farm produces cattle and corn; yet every
farm, I think, should have a patch of poetry, as
every professional poet certainly needs to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a garden and a pig. For years Burroughs grew
fancy grapes and celery for the New York
market, along with his literary essays for the
reading public.</p>

<p>As we came in on the vine-covered porch of
the Lodge, we were met by Dr. Barrus, Burroughs&#8217;s
physician and biographer, who told
us with considerable anxiety that the old man
was not at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is out visiting his traps, I suppose,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s just like a boy. I can&#8217;t do anything
with him. He&#8217;ll come home wringing
wet. And he&#8217;s not a bit well.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came home true to form. It was an hour
later, perhaps, that I saw, from the steps, a
dim figure in the blur of the rain: an old man
plodding slowly down the hill road, a stick and
a steel trap in his left hand, and in his right hand
a heavy woodchuck.</p>

<p>It was John Burroughs, the real Burroughs,
for I knew as I watched him that I had never
seen, never clearly seen, this man before&mdash;not
exactly this simple, rain-soaked man with the
snow of more than eighty winters on his head,
with the song of eternal springtime in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
heart, and a woodchuck, like a lantern, in his
hand.</p>

<p>This figure in the rain should be seen coming
down every page of Burroughs&#8217;s books. Every
line should be read in the light of this lantern
in his hand, for its wick is in his heart, and
its flame shines from &#8220;Wake-Robin&#8221; to &#8220;The
Summit of the Years.&#8221; Burroughs was the
eternal boy&mdash;splashing through the puddles,
wet to the skin; the boy for whom these fields of
his father&#8217;s farm were as wild as the jungles of
Africa; and this woodchuck in his hand (it <i>was</i>
a big one!) a very elephant, except for the tusks.
But to be like this is to be both boy and philosopher&mdash;boy
and writer, I should say. And to
see him thus&mdash;falling with the rain, whirling
with the dust, singing with the birds, growing
with the grass, his whole being one with the
elements, earth and wild-life and weather&mdash;thus
to see the man is to know how to read his
books.</p>

<p>As he came up to the porch, his slouch hat
spouting like an eaves-trough, he greeted me
cordially, but as a stranger, not recognizing me
for an instant; then dashing the rain from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
eyes, he dropped the woodchuck, drew off, and
with a quick righthander to my chest, which
almost took me off my feet, he cried, &#8220;Sharp,
we&#8217;ll have woodchuck for dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>And we did&mdash;not the one he had just dropped
on the floor, for that one he skinned and salted
and gave me to bring home to Boston. We had
canned woodchuck that noon at the Lodge. It
was Burroughs&#8217;s custom to serve his guests a
real literary dinner; and of course it must savor
of the locality.</p>

<p>This called for woodchuck, or &#8220;Roxbury
Lamb,&#8221; as you preferred; and for roast Roxbury
Lamb the rule for rabbit-stew prevails: first get
your woodchuck; not always readily done, for
the meat-market down at the village is sometimes
out of woodchuck. So the Laird of the
Lodge keeps them canned ahead.</p>

<p>The clouds cleared in the afternoon, the sun
came down upon the mountains, and we looked
out from the porch over a world so large and
new and lovely that I remember it still as a
keen pain, so unprepared was I for it, with my
level background of meadow and marsh and
bay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Endless reaches of river and bay, of wavy
marshland and hazy barrens of pine, were my
heritage of landscape as a child. And I have
never been able to measure up to the mountains,
nor to this scene, here from the porch&mdash;this
reach without level; space both deep and high
as well as wide; this valley completely hiding a
village below you; ridges above you where stone
walls climb over the sky; mountains far across
with forests flung over their shoulders, and
farms, like colored patchwork, stitched into
the rents of the forests; runnels singing down
the pastures; and roads, your road to school,
so close to the verge that only the stone wall
stays you from stepping off the edge of the
world!</p>

<p>None of this had I known as a boy. &#8220;Who
couldn&#8217;t write,&#8221; I muttered, &#8220;born into this
glorious world!&#8221; I have seen much grander
mountains. &#8220;Not a rugged, masculine touch in
all the view,&#8221; Burroughs said to me. &#8220;It is all
sweet and feminine, and doubtless has had a
feminizing influence upon my character and writing.&#8221;
It may be so. There is a plenty of wilder,
stormier landscape than this in these Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Catskills, but certainly none that I ever saw that
is lovelier for a human home. And here Burroughs
now sleeps, under the boulder where he
played as a child, and where all this beauty of
winding valley and blue, bending sky upon the
mountains lies forever about him.</p>

<p>There is something terribly important and
lasting about childhood. Almost any environment
will do, if only the child is happy. It is
the child who counts. In every child the world
is recreated and in his memory stays recreated.
More and more, as the years lengthen, do we
find ourselves longing&mdash;for the pine barrens,
for the vast green reach of the marshes; and
were my feet free this summer day, they would
run with my heart to the river&mdash;not to the
mountains; to the river, the Maurice River,
where the bubbling wrens build in the smother
of reed and calamus, and where this very day
the pink-white marshmallows make, at high
noon, a gorgeous sunset over miles of the meadows.
I love and understand those great, green
levels of marshland as I shall love and understand
no other face of nature, it may be. I know
perfectly what Lanier means when he sings,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea?</div>
<div class="verse">Somehow my soul seems suddenly free</div>
<div class="verse">From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,</div>
<div class="verse">By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I said the clouds cleared late that afternoon,
but it was still raining when, after dinner, I
brought a box from the woodshed to the front
porch for Burroughs to skin the woodchuck.
Here we sat down together, the flabby, flaccid
marmot between us, the whole October afternoon
our own.</p>

<p>Burroughs pulled a rudimentary whetstone
out of his coat pocket and touched up the blade
of his knife&mdash;of his spirit, too, running his
thumb along the blade of every faculty as he
settled to the skinning, his shining eyes, his
vibrant voice, his eager movements, all showing
how razor-keen an edge the old man was still
capable of taking. He got hold of a forefoot of
the &#8217;chuck and started to talk on the flight of
birds, reviewing the various stages of the controversy
on the soaring of hawks that he had
been carrying on in the press, when, suddenly
dropping his knife, he disappeared through the
door and returned in a minute with a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
some scientist, whose argument, as I remember
it, was wholly at variance with Burroughs&#8217;s
theory, but which closed with a strange word,
a word the old man had never seen before and
could not find in his dictionary. It was some
aeronautical term, I think. Handing me the
letter, his finger, as well as his eyes, fastened to
that stranger from beyond the dictionary, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That chap doesn&#8217;t know much about soaring
hawks; but there&#8217;s a new word. See that!
He knows a heap more than I do about the
English language.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down to the skinning again. No cut
had yet been made, nor ever would be made,
apparently, unless he used the back of his blade,
for it was plain that Burroughs kept that old
whetstone for his wits only. He sawed away
and talked as if inspired. I held the other forefoot,
a short, broad foot, like a side-hill gouger&#8217;s,
on the oldest, toughest &#8217;chuck in the Catskills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I am going to do?&#8221; he
asked, switching the conversation into the hard-working
knife. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pickle this old
rascal and send him by you to your family. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
want you all to have a dish of &#8216;Roxbury
Lamb.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we have our own Hingham Lamb out
on Mullein Hill,&#8221; I suggested cautiously. &#8220;And
I don&#8217;t like to rob you this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No robbery at all. Besides, these are a better
breed than yours in Hingham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my folks don&#8217;t seem very fond of
&#8217;em,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;They cook with a rank
odor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know how to prepare them,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;Let me show you a trick,&#8221; and
deftly cutting in between the neck and the
shoulder, he took out the thyroid glands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re going to take this one home.
There&#8217;ll be no strong smell when you cook this
fellow.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our talk turned to poetry&mdash;the skinning
still going forward&mdash;the woodchuck brimming
full of verse; for Burroughs, at every other turn
of his knife, would seem to open up a vein of
song. The beauty of nature to Burroughs had
always been more than skin deep. He wanted
the skin for a coat; the carcass he wanted for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
roast; but here was a chance for him to look into
some of the hidden, fearful things of nature, and
the sight inside of that woodchuck made him
stop and sing.</p>

<p>But how old and frail he looked! And he was
old, very old, eighty-four the coming April 9.
And he was suddenly sad.</p>

<p>Resting a bit from his labor, he began to chant
to the slackening rain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;&#8217;Tis a dull sight</div>
<div class="indent">To see the year dying.</div>
<div class="verse">When winter winds</div>
<div class="indent">Set yellow woods sighing,</div>
<div class="verse">Sighing, O sighing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;When such a time cometh,</div>
<div class="indent">I do retire</div>
<div class="verse">Into an old room</div>
<div class="indent">Beside a bright fire;</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, pile a bright fire!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;I never look out</div>
<div class="indent">Nor attend to the blast,</div>
<div class="verse">For all to be seen</div>
<div class="indent">Is the leaves falling fast,</div>
<div class="verse">Falling, falling!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And he rubbed his thin hands together, spread
them to the warmth, and repeated two or three
times,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Oh, pile a bright fire!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Oh, pile a bright fire!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>More than once, I heard him returning to
those lines; and saw him several times reading
the last stanzas of the poem from a typewritten
copy on his porch table, chafing his hands the
while, and extending them before the imaginary
fire as if they were cold, or as if he felt through
his hands, so sensitive was he physically, an
actual fire in the written lines. The poem is
Edward Fitzgerald&#8217;s &#8220;Old Song,&#8221; and I am
sure Burroughs was learning it by heart, and
making rather hard work of it, I thought, for
one who had already in memory so much good
poetry. But he was getting very old.</p>

<p>Then, at my request he said some of the lines
of his own poem, &#8220;Waiting.&#8221; &#8220;The only thing
I ever did,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;with real poetry in
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the philosophy in it,&#8221; I inquired,
&#8220;Do you find it sound after all these years?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an audible chuckle inside of him.
Then rather solemnly he replied: &#8220;My father
killed himself early trying to clear these acres
of debts and stones. I might have been in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
grave, too, these forty years had I tried to hurry
it his way. I waited. By and by Henry Ford
came along and cleared up the whole farm for
me. Here I am, and here</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;Serene, I fold my hands and wait,</div>
<div class="indent">Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;</div>
<div class="verse">I rave no more &#8217;gainst Time or Fate,</div>
<div class="indent">For lo! my own shall come to me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>We were soon deep in a discussion of free
verse, no hungry trout ever rising to the fly
with more snap than Burroughs. He called
the free-verse writers the Reds of American
literature, the figure sticking to him, until some
months later in California he worked the idea
out into a brief newspaper article under that
title, the last piece, I think, for publication from
his pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Name me one good modern poem,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;moulded on the old forms, with rhyme and
meter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let go his knife again, turned his face once
more to the rain, through which the mountains
were now emerging, and asked,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Loveman&#8217;s &#8216;Raining&#8217; and
how he wandered up from Georgia to find himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in New York City, his boat gone, or his
money gone, or something gone&mdash;for he was
someway stranded, I believe&mdash;and it was raining?&#8221;
And the old man began&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="versefirst">&#8220;&#8216;It isn&#8217;t raining rain to me,</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;s raining daffodils;</div>
<div class="verse">In every dimpled drop I see</div>
<div class="verse">Wild flowers on the hills.</div>
<div class="verse">The clouds of gray engulf the day,</div>
<div class="verse">And overwhelm the town,</div>
<div class="verse">It isn&#8217;t raining rain to me,</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;s raining roses down.,&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>while the rain across the hills, shot through with
sunset light, fell all violets and clover-bloom
and roses on the mountains and on the roof of
Woodchuck Lodge.</p>

<p>The thing on the box between us was utterly
forgotten, but only for the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn those fleas!&#8221; the old poet exploded,
at the end of the recitation, swinging with both
hands at his long white whiskers, &#8220;That &#8217;chuck&#8217;s
alive with fleas!&#8221;</p>

<p>So I had observed; and I had been speculating,
as I watched them quitting their sinking craft
and boarding the sweeping beard of the poet,
how many of them it might take to halt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
flow of song. I was far off in my reckoning.
Burroughs knocked them out and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good poem because it goes straight
to the heart. It&#8217;s an experience. He lived it.
And its form is perfect. You can&#8217;t change a
syllable in it. It&#8217;s on the old forms, yet it&#8217;s true
to itself. And see how simple, direct, and sincere
it is! and how lovely! I call that good poetry.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had been more than three hours getting
the pelt off that woodchuck and all of the poetry
out of him. As I sat by, I saw what I had hardly
realized before: that the hand with the knife
must often rest, though the eager mind seemed
almost incapable of resting.</p>

<p>The national elections were approaching,
and from poetry we plunged into politics, where
I feared we were bound to disagree, but where,
to my surprise, I found we were standing together
on the League of Nations, Burroughs
having forsaken his party on that issue.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only thing!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what we fought for. Rob us of that, and the
whole terrible sacrifice is futile&mdash;criminal!&#8221;</p>

<p>And later, after my return home, he wrote me:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;Well, the elections did not go as both of us
had hoped. DeLoach was on the winning side,
as I suppose all the great moneyed interests
were. But thank heaven I am not in that crowd.
If it means an utter repudiation of the League
of Nations, then for the first time I am ashamed
that I am an American. If I were in Europe I
could not hold up my head and say, &#8216;I am from
the United States!&#8217; If we have failed to see
ourselves as a member of the great family of
nations, with solemn duties toward the rest of
the world, to perform as such a member, then
we have slumped morally as badly as did the
Germans when they set out to enslave the rest
of the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>But to return to Woodchuck Lodge, to the
old man with the boy&#8217;s jack-knife in his hand,
and the boy&#8217;s heart in his breast&mdash;and so, the
poet&#8217;s outlook in his eyes. For he was more
poet than scientist, more poet than theologian,
though every poet, like all Gaul, is divided into
three parts, and these&mdash;science, music, and
theology&mdash;are the parts.</p>

<p>The theologian is the ultimate thinker. His
chief attribute is consistency&mdash;even unto death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Nothing will shatter a system of theology as
will a trifling inconsistency. Burroughs was a
bad theologian, the worst I know by the test
of consistency. Yet who among the theologians
is more religious? Or leaves us with a realer
consciousness of the presence of God in nature?</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I approach this thing from different
angles,&#8221; he said to me. &#8220;We come to God
down different roads. Our terms differ. You
say &#8216;Father.&#8217; I say &#8216;Nature.&#8217; But whatever
we call Him, He is the same, and the same for
each of us. Our divergent paths at the start,
come out together at the end. We worship the
same God.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did differ radically in our approach, in our
terminology, and as I had always thought, must
of necessity differ as radically in our faiths and
works. That was a foolish, vainglorious conceit.
I wish every disconcerted reader of &#8220;The Light
of Day&#8221; and &#8220;Accepting the Universe&#8221; had
heard the old author interpret himself that day.
That reader would have understood, as he sat
there watching the light of a real day breaking
in over the rainy autumn landscape, what
Carruth meant by,</p>

<p>The pelt was finally off; the carcass in pickle
for me; and the sun was out, flooding Montgomery
Valley and the heaving ranges beyond.
An automobile load of callers came, stopped a
little time, and went away; another load came
and went away, and Burroughs, now quite
rested, brought out the manuscripts of two new
books, which were about ready for the publishers.</p>

<p>I looked at the piles of work, then at the frail
old man who had heaped them up, and thought
with shame of my own strength&mdash;and laziness.
To be approaching eighty-four with one book
on the press and two other books in manuscript!
What a long steady stroke he had pulled
across these more than sixty years of writing
to be bringing him in at the finish, two full
volumes ahead of the race! Three volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
indeed, for &#8220;Accepting the Universe&#8221; had not
yet come from the press.</p>

<p>The quiet and calm of it all deeply impressed
me. The extreme opposite in temperament
and action from his friend Roosevelt, there was
nothing &#8220;strenuous&#8221; about this plodding old
man, nor ever had been. &#8220;Serene I fold my
hands and wait&#8221; he had written in his twenty-third
year, and had practiced all these four-and-eighty
years. Yet look at this amount of
durable work accomplished. It is well for us
Americans to remember just now that there is
another than the &#8220;strenuous&#8221; type of life,
which is just as worthy of emulation, and which
is likely to be even more effective.</p>

<p>This was an October day at Woodchuck
Lodge. Sixty-one years before the &#8220;Atlantic
Monthly&#8221; was actually printing Burroughs&#8217;s
first essay, &#8220;Expression.&#8221; I looked at the old
man beside me with the pen in his fingers.
Was it the same man? the same pen? Lowell
was the editor; then Fields, Howells, Aldrich,
Scudder, Page, Perry, to the present editor,
who has held his chair these dozen years; and I
watched the pen in Burroughs&#8217;s hand travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
slowly across a corrected line of the manuscript
and I remembered that in all the years since
Lowell was editor, not for a single year had that
pen failed to appear in the pages of the &#8220;Atlantic.&#8221;
Was it strange that as I looked from the
pen away to the Catskills surrounding me I
wondered if I were really looking into Montgomery
Valley and not into Sleepy Hollow?</p>

<p>We guests had a plenty that night, but Burroughs
went to bed supperless. We guests slept
indoors, but Burroughs made his bed out on the
front porch, where he could see the stars come
over the mountains, and the gates of dawn
swing wide on the wooded crests, when the new
sweet day should come through and down into
Montgomery Valley.</p>

<p>For Burroughs has lived and loved everything
he has written. He cannot write of anything
else. Our present-day writers, especially
our poets and nature writers, take the wings of
the morning (or of the night) unto the uttermost
parts of the earth for copy. Burroughs
visited distant places; but he always wrote about
the things at home. &#8220;Fresh Fields,&#8221; to be sure,
is out of England; yet England was only an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
older home. Burroughs had seen strange, extraordinary,
tropical things; seen them, to write
little about them, however, for it is only the
homely, the ordinary, the familiar things that
stirred his imagination and moved his pen.
These were his things, the furniture of his house,
the folks of his town; for it was the hearth where
he lived, his home, that he loved, and it was the
creatures living on it with him that gave him
his great theme. &#8220;The whole gospel of my
books,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;is stay at home, see the
wonderful and beautiful and the simple things
all about you. Make the most of the near at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a constant wonder to me how one could
be so simple as Burroughs, and yet know so
many places, persons, and books. Burroughs
had met many people; he had read many books,
and had written more than a score himself; yet
he was the simplest man I ever knew, as simple
as a child,&mdash;simpler, indeed. For children may
be suspicious and self-conscious, and even uninterested;
but Burroughs&#8217;s interest and curiosity
grew with the years. He carried his culture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
his knife and his whetstone in his pocket. They
belonged to him; but he belonged strictly to
himself. He remained to the end what the Lord
made him&mdash;and that is to be original.</p>

<p>Pietro, the sculptor, has made Burroughs in
bronze, resting on a rock, his arm shading his
face, his eyes peering keenly into the future or
the far-away. Pietro has made him a seer or a
prophet. He was much more the lover and the
poet. I sat with Burroughs on that same rock,
the morning after the rainy day at the Lodge,
and talked with him of some things long past,
of many things round about us, but of few
things of the future. I saw him shield his face
with his arm, and look far off from the rock&mdash;to
the rounded, green-crested hills in the distance,
and down into the beautiful valley below.
But most of the time he was watching a chipmunk
near by, or scanning the pasture for woodchucks.
Had I been Pietro I should have made
the old man flat on that boulder, his beard a
patch of lichen, his slouch hat hard down on
his eyes, his head just over the round of the rock&mdash;and
down the slope, at the mouth of his
burrow, a big woodchuck on his haunches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been studying the woodchuck all my
life,&#8221; he said, as we sat there on the rock, &#8220;and
there is no getting to the bottom of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not know whether Burroughs climbed
over the walls and up through the field again
to this favorite spot of his boyhood in the few
remaining days he had at the Lodge. This may
have been the last time he looked out with seeing
eyes over this landscape of valley and mountain
that had been one of the deepest, most
abiding influences of his life. As we sat there
together, the largeness and glory of the world:
colors, contours, the valley depths, the quiet
hills, the wealth of life, the full, deep flood of
autumn light&mdash;almost too much for common
human eyes&mdash;the old man beside me said,
with a sigh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I love it. But it is hard to live up to it.
Sometimes, especially of late, I feel it a burden
too great to bear.&#8221; Then, as if guilty of some
evil thought, he brightened instantly, pointed
out a dam that he had built as a boy in the field
below us, for his own swimming-hole, the ridge
of sod and stone still showing; told me stories
of his parents; described his sugar-making in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
&#8220;bush&#8221; behind us; nor referred again to the
burden of the years, weighing so heavily now
upon him, until we were leaving. Then, as he
came out to the road to see us off, he said with
tears in his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to have you go. I wish you could
stay. You boys are life to me now. Come again
soon. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>We promised we would, and we did&mdash;in
April, the next April, when we went up to say
our last good-bye. Meantime he was off to
California for the winter months. Before leaving
he wrote to me from West Park, his home on
the Hudson:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I neglected to make any apologies for the long letter
I wrote you the other day. I promise not to do
so again. I am sending you an old notebook of mine,
filled with all sorts of jottings, as you will see. I send
it as a keepsake.</p>

<p>We are off for California to-morrow. Hope to be
there in early December. We leave Chicago on the
29th. My address there will be La Jolla, San Diego.
Good luck to you and yours.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gap">Ever your friend</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Burroughs</span></p></blockquote>

<p>He kept his promise. This was his last letter
to me. They were not very happy months in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
California. Visitors came to see him as usual;
he spoke in the schools; and wrote up to the
very end; but he was weak, often sick, and
always longing for home. He knew if he was
ever to see home again he must not delay long;
and he counted the days. He wished to celebrate
his birthday with his old friends, at the
old place; and he was on the way, speeding
homeward, with most of the long journey covered,
when, suddenly, the end came. And is it
at all strange that his last uttered words, as he
sank into unconsciousness, should have been
&#8220;How far are we from home?&#8221;</p>

<p>On the front of the boulder which marks his
grave, those last words might well be cut, as
expressing the real theme of all his books, the
dominant note in all his life.</p>

<p>His old friends kept his birthday in the old
place&mdash;in the &#8220;Nest&#8221; at Riverby, for the
funeral; and the next day, his eighty-fourth
birthday, they carried him into his beloved
mountains, to his grave by the rock, where so
lately we had talked together, and where, since
childhood, he had found an altar for his soul.</p>

<p>How great a man Burroughs was I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
know. Time knows. I know that he had three
of the elements of greatness as a writer: simplicity,
sincerity, and a true feeling for form.
And he had these to an uncommon degree. I
know that great men and little children loved
him; and that three generations already have
been led oftener and farther into the out-of-doors
by him than by any other American
writer. I know how Burroughs thought of himself
and of Thoreau; for in a letter, several
years ago to me he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thoreau is nearer the stars than I am. I may be
more human, but he is as certainly more divine.
His moral and ethical value I think is much greater,
and he has a heroic quality that I cannot approach.</p></blockquote>

<p>But I am not trying to estimate Burroughs.
I am only sketching, through the gray rain and
in the golden light at the far end of the autumn,
one whom thousands of us read and love.</p>
